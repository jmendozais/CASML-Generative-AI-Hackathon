The text also includes coverage of the DSM-5 in examinations of psychological disorders. Psychology 2e incorporates discussions that reflect the diversity within the discipline, as well as the diversity of cultures and communities across the globe.Coverage and scopeThe first edition of Psychology has been used by thousands of faculty and hundreds of thousands of students since its publication in 2015. OpenStax mined our adopters' extensive and helpful feedback to identify the most significant revision needs while maintaining the organization that many instructors had incorporated into their courses. Specific surveys, pre-revision reviews, and customization analysis, as well as analytical data from OpenStax partners and online learning environments, all aided in planning the revision.The result is a book that thoroughly treats psychology's foundational concepts while adding current and meaningful coverage in specific areas. Psychology 2e retains its manageable scope and contains ample features to draw learners into the discipline.Structurally, the textbook remains similar to the first edition, with no chapter reorganization and very targeted changes at the section level.Chapter 1: Introduction to PsychologyChapter 2: Psychological ResearchChapter 3: BiopsychologyChapter 4: States of ConsciousnessChapter 5: Sensation and PerceptionChapter 6: LearningChapter 7: Thinking and IntelligenceChapter 8: MemoryChapter 9: Lifespan DevelopmentChapter 10: Motivation and EmotionChapter 11: PersonalityChapter 12: Social PsychologyChapter 13: Industrial-Organizational PsychologyChapter 14: Stress, Lifestyle, and HealthChapter 15: Psychological DisordersChapter 16: Therapy and TreatmentChanges to the Second EditionOpenStax only undertakes second editions when significant modifications to the text are necessary. In the case of Psychology 2e, user feedback indicated that we needed to focus on a few key areas, which we have done in the following ways.Content revisions for clarity, accuracy, and currencyThe revision plan varied by chapter based on need. Some chapters were significantly updated for conceptual coverage, research-informed data, and clearer language. In other chapters, the revisions focused mostly on currency of examples and updates to statistics.Over 210 new research references have been added or updated in order to improve the scholarly underpinnings of the material and broaden the perspective for students. Dozens of examples and feature boxes have been changed or added to better explain concepts and/or increase relevance for students.Research replication and validityTo engage students in stronger critical analysis and inform them about research reproducibility, substantial coverage has been added to the research chapter and strategically throughout the textbook whenever keyAccess for free at openstax.org</td><td>Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology</td></tr><tr><td>47</td><td>11</td><td>Access for free at openstax.org</td><td>Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology</td></tr><tr><td>46</td><td>15</td><td>4 Prefaceand Social Norms,\" and \"Conditioning and OCD.\"Art, interactives, and assessments that engageOur art program is designed to enhance students' understanding of psychological concepts through simple, effective graphs, diagrams, and photographs. Psychology 2e also incorporates links to relevant interactive exercises and animations that help bring topics to life. Selected assessment items touch directly on students' lives.Link to Learning features direct students to online interactive exercises and animations that add a fuller context to core content and provide an opportunity for application.Personal Application Questions engage students in topics at a personal level to encourage reflection and promote discussion.Additional ResourcesStudent and Instructor ResourcesWe've compiled additional resources for both students and instructors, including Getting Started Guides, an instructor solution guide, a test bank, and PowerPoint slides. Instructor resources require a verified instructor account, which you can apply for when you log in or create your account on openstax.org. Take advantage of these resources to supplement your OpenStax book.Community HubsOpenStax partners with the Institute for the Study of Knowledge Management in Education (ISKME) to offer Community Hubs on OER Commons—a platform for instructors to share community-created resources that support OpenStax books, free of charge. Through our Community Hubs, instructors can upload their own materials or download resources to use in their own courses, including additional ancillaries, teaching material, multimedia, and relevant course content. We encourage instructors to join the hubs for the subjects most relevant to your teaching and research as an opportunity both to enrich your courses and to engage with other faculty.To reach the Community Hubs, visit www.oercommons.org/hubs/openstax.Technology partnersAs allies in making high-quality learning materials accessible, our technology partners offer optional low-cost tools that are integrated with OpenStax books. To access the technology options for your text, visit your book page on openstax.org.About the authorsSenior contributing authorsRose M.

Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these experiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain's internal processes and people's external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of psychology has explored these questions.1.1 What Is Psychology?LEARNING OBJECTIVESBy the end of this section, you will be able to:Define psychologyUnderstand the merits of an education in psychologyWhat is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology explores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists use the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question about how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the phenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or group of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over time. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes observations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then published or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.Scientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because it is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We must ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However, we can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus, psychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.In general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot arrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the mind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific method is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on observation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or previous authorities.It was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this time, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is, at its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological organism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore, psychology is also a social science.WHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?Often, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to learn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course because it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as nursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare psychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses across the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology majors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook's creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality and political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About 6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S. Department of Education, 2016).Access for free at openstax.org</td><td>Introduction to Psychology/Contemporary Psychology</td></tr><tr><td>41</td><td>18</td><td>1Introduction to PsychologyFIGURE 1.1 Psychology is the scientific study of mind and behavior.

While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember what he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is associated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend's name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John Nash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would tell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended for him. He also began to hear voices and became suspicious of the people around him. Soon thereafter, Nash was diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to a state-run mental institution (O'Connor & Robertson,</td><td>Introduction to Psychology/Contemporary Psychology</td></tr><tr><td>40</td><td>9</td><td>11.7 Trait Theorists 379\n",

This material is presented in a balanced way and provides instructors with ample opportunity to discuss the importance of replication in a manner that best suits their course.Diversity, representation, and inclusionWith the help of researchers and teachers who focus on diversity- and identity-related issues, OpenStax has engaged in detailed diversity reviews to identify opportunities to improve the textbook. Reviewers were asked to follow a framework to evaluate the book's terminology, research citations, key contributors to the field, photos and illustrations, and related aspects, commenting on the representation and consideration of diverse groups. Significant additions and revisions were made in this regard, and the review framework itself is available among the OpenStax Psychology 2e instructor resources.Art and illustrationsUnder the guidance of the authors and expert scientific illustrators, especially those well versed in creating accessible art, the OpenStax team made changes throughout the art program in Psychology 2e.Accessibility improvementsAs with all OpenStax books, the first edition of Psychology was created with a focus on accessibility. We have emphasized and improved that approach in the second edition. Our goal is to ensure that all OpenStax websites and the web view versions of our learning materials follow accessible web design best practices, so that they will meet the W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 at Level AA and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. The WCAG 2.0 guidelines explain ways to make web content more accessible for people with disabilities and more user-friendly for everyone.To accommodate users of specific assistive technologies, all alternative text was reviewed and revised for comprehensiveness and clarity.- All illustrations were revised to improve the color contrast, which is important for some visually impaired students.Overall, the OpenStax platform has been continually upgraded to improve accessibility.To learn more about our commitment and progress, please view our accessibility statement (https://openstax.org/accessibility-statement).A transition guide will be available on openstax.org to highlight the specific chapter-level changes to the second edition.Pedagogical foundationPsychology 2e engages students through inquiry, self-reflection, and investigation. Features in the second edition have been carefully updated to remain topical and relevant while deepening students' relationship to the material. They include the following:- Everyday Connection features tie psychological topics to everyday issues and behaviors that students encounter in their lives and the world. Topics include the validity of scores on college entrance exams, the opioid crisis, the impact of social status on stress and healthcare, and cognitive mapping.What Do You Think? features provide research-based information and ask students their views on controversial issues. Topics include “Brain Dead and on Life Support,” “Violent Media and Aggression,” and “Capital Punishment and Criminals with Intellectual Disabilities.”Dig Deeper features discuss one specific aspect of a topic in greater depth so students can dig more deeply into the concept. Examples include discussions on the distinction between evolutionary psychology and behavioral genetics, recent findings on neuroplasticity, the field of forensic psychology, and a presentation of research on strategies for coping with prejudice and discrimination.Connect the Concepts features revisit a concept learned in another chapter, expanding upon it within a different context.

Psychology 2e incorporates discussions that reflect the diversity within the discipline, as well as the diversity of cultures and communities across the globe.Coverage and scopeThe first edition of Psychology has been used by thousands of faculty and hundreds of thousands of students since its publication in 2015. OpenStax mined our adopters' extensive and helpful feedback to identify the most significant revision needs while maintaining the organization that many instructors had incorporated into their courses. Specific surveys, pre-revision reviews, and customization analysis, as well as analytical data from OpenStax partners and online learning environments, all aided in planning the revision.The result is a book that thoroughly treats psychology's foundational concepts while adding current and meaningful coverage in specific areas. Psychology 2e retains its manageable scope and contains ample features to draw learners into the discipline.Structurally, the textbook remains similar to the first edition, with no chapter reorganization and very targeted changes at the section level.Chapter 1: Introduction to PsychologyChapter 2: Psychological ResearchChapter 3: BiopsychologyChapter 4: States of ConsciousnessChapter 5: Sensation and PerceptionChapter 6: LearningChapter 7: Thinking and IntelligenceChapter 8: MemoryChapter 9: Lifespan DevelopmentChapter 10: Motivation and EmotionChapter 11: PersonalityChapter 12: Social PsychologyChapter 13: Industrial-Organizational PsychologyChapter 14: Stress, Lifestyle, and HealthChapter 15: Psychological DisordersChapter 16: Therapy and TreatmentChanges to the Second EditionOpenStax only undertakes second editions when significant modifications to the text are necessary. In the case of Psychology 2e, user feedback indicated that we needed to focus on a few key areas, which we have done in the following ways.Content revisions for clarity, accuracy, and currencyThe revision plan varied by chapter based on need. Some chapters were significantly updated for conceptual coverage, research-informed data, and clearer language. In other chapters, the revisions focused mostly on currency of examples and updates to statistics.Over 210 new research references have been added or updated in order to improve the scholarly underpinnings of the material and broaden the perspective for students. Dozens of examples and feature boxes have been changed or added to better explain concepts and/or increase relevance for students.Research replication and validityTo engage students in stronger critical analysis and inform them about research reproducibility, substantial coverage has been added to the research chapter and strategically throughout the textbook whenever keyAccess for free at openstax.org",

         "8 1 Introduction to Psychology2002). Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these experiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain's internal processes and people's external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of psychology has explored these questions.1.1 What Is Psychology?LEARNING OBJECTIVESBy the end of this section, you will be able to:Define psychologyUnderstand the merits of an education in psychologyWhat is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology explores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists use the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question about how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the phenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or group of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over time. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes observations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then published or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.Scientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because it is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We must ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However, we can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus, psychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.In general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot arrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the mind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific method is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on observation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or previous authorities.It was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this time, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is, at its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological organism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore, psychology is also a social science.WHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?Often, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to learn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course because it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as nursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare psychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses across the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology majors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook's creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality and political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About 6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S. Department of Education, 2016).Access for free at openstax.org",

While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember what he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is associated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend's name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John Nash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would tell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended for him. He also began to hear voices and became suspicious of the people around him. Soon thereafter, Nash was diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to a state-run mental institution (O'Connor & Robertson,",

         "Prefacestudies are discussed. This material is presented in a balanced way and provides instructors with ample opportunity to discuss the importance of replication in a manner that best suits their course.Diversity, representation, and inclusionWith the help of researchers and teachers who focus on diversity- and identity-related issues, OpenStax has engaged in detailed diversity reviews to identify opportunities to improve the textbook. Reviewers were asked to follow a framework to evaluate the book's terminology, research citations, key contributors to the field, photos and illustrations, and related aspects, commenting on the representation and consideration of diverse groups. Significant additions and revisions were made in this regard, and the review framework itself is available among the OpenStax Psychology 2e instructor resources.Art and illustrationsUnder the guidance of the authors and expert scientific illustrators, especially those well versed in creating accessible art, the OpenStax team made changes throughout the art program in Psychology 2e.Accessibility improvementsAs with all OpenStax books, the first edition of Psychology was created with a focus on accessibility. We have emphasized and improved that approach in the second edition. Our goal is to ensure that all OpenStax websites and the web view versions of our learning materials follow accessible web design best practices, so that they will meet the W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 at Level AA and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. The WCAG 2.0 guidelines explain ways to make web content more accessible for people with disabilities and more user-friendly for everyone.To accommodate users of specific assistive technologies, all alternative text was reviewed and revised for comprehensiveness and clarity.- All illustrations were revised to improve the color contrast, which is important for some visually impaired students.Overall, the OpenStax platform has been continually upgraded to improve accessibility.To learn more about our commitment and progress, please view our accessibility statement (https://openstax.org/accessibility-statement).A transition guide will be available on openstax.org to highlight the specific chapter-level changes to the second edition.Pedagogical foundationPsychology 2e engages students through inquiry, self-reflection, and investigation. Features in the second edition have been carefully updated to remain topical and relevant while deepening students' relationship to the material. They include the following:- Everyday Connection features tie psychological topics to everyday issues and behaviors that students encounter in their lives and the world. Topics include the validity of scores on college entrance exams, the opioid crisis, the impact of social status on stress and healthcare, and cognitive mapping.What Do You Think? features provide research-based information and ask students their views on controversial issues. Topics include “Brain Dead and on Life Support,” “Violent Media and Aggression,” and “Capital Punishment and Criminals with Intellectual Disabilities.”Dig Deeper features discuss one specific aspect of a topic in greater depth so students can dig more deeply into the concept. Examples include discussions on the distinction between evolutionary psychology and behavioral genetics, recent findings on neuroplasticity, the field of forensic psychology, and a presentation of research on strategies for coping with prejudice and discrimination.Connect the Concepts features revisit a concept learned in another chapter, expanding upon it within a different context. Features include “Emotional Expression and Emotional Regulation,” “Tweens, Teens,",

Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these experiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain\\'s internal processes and people\\'s external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of psychology has explored these questions.1.1 What Is Psychology?LEARNING OBJECTIVESBy the end of this section, you will be able to:Define psychologyUnderstand the merits of an education in psychologyWhat is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology explores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists use the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question about how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the phenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or group of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over time. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes observations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then published or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.Scientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because it is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We must ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However, we can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus, psychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.In general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot arrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the mind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific method is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on observation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or previous authorities.It was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this time, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is, at its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological organism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore, psychology is also a social science.WHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?Often, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to learn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course because it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as nursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare psychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses across the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology majors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook\\'s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality and political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About 6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S. Department of Education, 2016).Access for free at openstax.org\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/Contemporary Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 18.0, \\'id\\': 29.0}, page_content=\\'1Introduction to PsychologyFIGURE 1.1 Psychology is the scientific study of mind and behavior.

While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember what he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is associated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend\\\\\\'s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John Nash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would tell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended for him. He also began to hear voices and became suspicious of the people around him. Soon thereafter, Nash was diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to a state-run mental institution (O\\\\\\'Connor & Robertson,\\'), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 11.0, \\'id\\': 35.0}, page_content=\\'Access for free at openstax.org\\'), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 17.0, \\'id\\': 33.0}, page_content=\\'6 PrefaceChristine Selby, Husson University\\\\nSally B.

This material is presented in a balanced way and provides instructors with ample opportunity to discuss the importance of replication in a manner that best suits their course.Diversity, representation, and inclusionWith the help of researchers and teachers who focus on diversity- and identity-related issues, OpenStax has engaged in detailed diversity reviews to identify opportunities to improve the textbook. Reviewers were asked to follow a framework to evaluate the book\\'s terminology, research citations, key contributors to the field, photos and illustrations, and related aspects, commenting on the representation and consideration of diverse groups. Significant additions and revisions were made in this regard, and the review framework itself is available among the OpenStax Psychology 2e instructor resources.Art and illustrationsUnder the guidance of the authors and expert scientific illustrators, especially those well versed in creating accessible art, the OpenStax team made changes throughout the art program in Psychology 2e.Accessibility improvementsAs with all OpenStax books, the first edition of Psychology was created with a focus on accessibility. We have emphasized and improved that approach in the second edition. Our goal is to ensure that all OpenStax websites and the web view versions of our learning materials follow accessible web design best practices, so that they will meet the W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 at Level AA and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. The WCAG 2.0 guidelines explain ways to make web content more accessible for people with disabilities and more user-friendly for everyone.To accommodate users of specific assistive technologies, all alternative text was reviewed and revised for comprehensiveness and clarity.- All illustrations were revised to improve the color contrast, which is important for some visually impaired students.Overall, the OpenStax platform has been continually upgraded to improve accessibility.To learn more about our commitment and progress, please view our accessibility statement (https://openstax.org/accessibility-statement).A transition guide will be available on openstax.org to highlight the specific chapter-level changes to the second edition.Pedagogical foundationPsychology 2e engages students through inquiry, self-reflection, and investigation. Features in the second edition have been carefully updated to remain topical and relevant while deepening students\\' relationship to the material. They include the following:- Everyday Connection features tie psychological topics to everyday issues and behaviors that students encounter in their lives and the world. Topics include the validity of scores on college entrance exams, the opioid crisis, the impact of social status on stress and healthcare, and cognitive mapping.What Do You Think? features provide research-based information and ask students their views on controversial issues. Topics include “Brain Dead and on Life Support,” “Violent Media and Aggression,” and “Capital Punishment and Criminals with Intellectual Disabilities.”Dig Deeper features discuss one specific aspect of a topic in greater depth so students can dig more deeply into the concept. Examples include discussions on the distinction between evolutionary psychology and behavioral genetics, recent findings on neuroplasticity, the field of forensic psychology, and a presentation of research on strategies for coping with prejudice and discrimination.Connect the Concepts features revisit a concept learned in another chapter, expanding upon it within a different context. Features include “Emotional Expression and Emotional Regulation,” “Tweens, Teens,\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 13.0, \\'id\\': 36.0}, page_content=\"2 Prefacestudies and current and emerging research. The text also includes coverage of the DSM-5 in examinations of psychological disorders. Psychology 2e incorporates discussions that reflect the diversity within the discipline, as well as the diversity of cultures and communities across the globe.Coverage and scopeThe first edition of Psychology has been used by thousands of faculty and hundreds of thousands of students since its publication in 2015. OpenStax mined our adopters\\' extensive and helpful feedback to identify the most significant revision needs while maintaining the organization that many instructors had incorporated into their courses. Specific surveys, pre-revision reviews, and customization analysis, as well as analytical data from OpenStax partners and online learning environments, all aided in planning the revision.The result is a book that thoroughly treats psychology\\'s foundational concepts while adding current and meaningful coverage in specific areas. Psychology 2e retains its manageable scope and contains ample features to draw learners into the discipline.Structurally, the textbook remains similar to the first edition, with no chapter reorganization and very targeted changes at the section level.Chapter 1: Introduction to PsychologyChapter 2: Psychological ResearchChapter 3: BiopsychologyChapter 4: States of ConsciousnessChapter 5: Sensation and PerceptionChapter 6: LearningChapter 7: Thinking and IntelligenceChapter 8: MemoryChapter 9: Lifespan DevelopmentChapter 10: Motivation and EmotionChapter 11: PersonalityChapter 12: Social PsychologyChapter 13: Industrial-Organizational PsychologyChapter 14: Stress, Lifestyle, and HealthChapter 15: Psychological DisordersChapter 16: Therapy and TreatmentChanges to the Second EditionOpenStax only undertakes second editions when significant modifications to the text are necessary. In the case of Psychology 2e, user feedback indicated that we needed to focus on a few key areas, which we have done in the following ways.Content revisions for clarity, accuracy, and currencyThe revision plan varied by chapter based on need. Some chapters were significantly updated for conceptual coverage, research-informed data, and clearer language. In other chapters, the revisions focused mostly on currency of examples and updates to statistics.Over 210 new research references have been added or updated in order to improve the scholarly underpinnings of the material and broaden the perspective for students. Dozens of examples and feature boxes have been changed or added to better explain concepts and/or increase relevance for students.Research replication and validityTo engage students in stronger critical analysis and inform them about research reproducibility, substantial coverage has been added to the research chapter and strategically throughout the textbook whenever keyAccess for free at openstax.org\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 15.0, \\'id\\': 34.0}, page_content=\\'4 Prefaceand Social Norms,\" and \"Conditioning and OCD.\"Art, interactives, and assessments that engageOur art program is designed to enhance students\\\\\\' understanding of psychological concepts through simple, effective graphs, diagrams, and photographs. Psychology 2e also incorporates links to relevant interactive exercises and animations that help bring topics to life. Selected assessment items touch directly on students\\\\\\' lives.Link to Learning features direct students to online interactive exercises and animations that add a fuller context to core content and provide an opportunity for application.Personal Application Questions engage students in topics at a personal level to encourage reflection and promote discussion.Additional ResourcesStudent and Instructor ResourcesWe\\\\\\'ve compiled additional resources for both students and instructors, including Getting Started Guides, an instructor solution guide, a test bank, and PowerPoint slides.

Psychology 2e incorporates discussions that reflect the diversity within the discipline, as well as the diversity of cultures and communities across the globe.Coverage and scopeThe first edition of Psychology has been used by thousands of faculty and hundreds of thousands of students since its publication in 2015. OpenStax mined our adopters\\' extensive and helpful feedback to identify the most significant revision needs while maintaining the organization that many instructors had incorporated into their courses. Specific surveys, pre-revision reviews, and customization analysis, as well as analytical data from OpenStax partners and online learning environments, all aided in planning the revision.The result is a book that thoroughly treats psychology\\'s foundational concepts while adding current and meaningful coverage in specific areas. Psychology 2e retains its manageable scope and contains ample features to draw learners into the discipline.Structurally, the textbook remains similar to the first edition, with no chapter reorganization and very targeted changes at the section level.Chapter 1: Introduction to PsychologyChapter 2: Psychological ResearchChapter 3: BiopsychologyChapter 4: States of ConsciousnessChapter 5: Sensation and PerceptionChapter 6: LearningChapter 7: Thinking and IntelligenceChapter 8: MemoryChapter 9: Lifespan DevelopmentChapter 10: Motivation and EmotionChapter 11: PersonalityChapter 12: Social PsychologyChapter 13: Industrial-Organizational PsychologyChapter 14: Stress, Lifestyle, and HealthChapter 15: Psychological DisordersChapter 16: Therapy and TreatmentChanges to the Second EditionOpenStax only undertakes second editions when significant modifications to the text are necessary. In the case of Psychology 2e, user feedback indicated that we needed to focus on a few key areas, which we have done in the following ways.Content revisions for clarity, accuracy, and currencyThe revision plan varied by chapter based on need. Some chapters were significantly updated for conceptual coverage, research-informed data, and clearer language. In other chapters, the revisions focused mostly on currency of examples and updates to statistics.Over 210 new research references have been added or updated in order to improve the scholarly underpinnings of the material and broaden the perspective for students. Dozens of examples and feature boxes have been changed or added to better explain concepts and/or increase relevance for students.Research replication and validityTo engage students in stronger critical analysis and inform them about research reproducibility, substantial coverage has been added to the research chapter and strategically throughout the textbook whenever keyAccess for free at openstax.org\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/Contemporary Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 18.0, \\'id\\': 29.0}, page_content=\\'1Introduction to PsychologyFIGURE 1.1 Psychology is the scientific study of mind and behavior.

While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember what he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is associated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend\\\\\\'s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John Nash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would tell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended for him. He also began to hear voices and became suspicious of the people around him. Soon thereafter, Nash was diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to a state-run mental institution (O\\\\\\'Connor & Robertson,\\'), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/Contemporary Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 19.0, \\'id\\': 30.0}, page_content=\"8 1 Introduction to Psychology2002). Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these experiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain\\'s internal processes and people\\'s external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of psychology has explored these questions.1.1 What Is Psychology?LEARNING OBJECTIVESBy the end of this section, you will be able to:Define psychologyUnderstand the merits of an education in psychologyWhat is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology explores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists use the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question about how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the phenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or group of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over time. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes observations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then published or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.Scientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because it is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We must ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However, we can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus, psychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.In general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot arrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the mind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific method is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on observation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or previous authorities.It was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this time, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is, at its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological organism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore, psychology is also a social science.WHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?Often, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to learn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course because it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as nursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare psychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses across the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology majors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook\\'s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality and political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About 6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S. Department of Education, 2016).Access for free at openstax.org\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 17.0, \\'id\\': 33.0}, page_content=\\'6 PrefaceChristine Selby, Husson University\\\\nSally B.

This material is presented in a balanced way and provides instructors with ample opportunity to discuss the importance of replication in a manner that best suits their course.Diversity, representation, and inclusionWith the help of researchers and teachers who focus on diversity- and identity-related issues, OpenStax has engaged in detailed diversity reviews to identify opportunities to improve the textbook. Reviewers were asked to follow a framework to evaluate the book\\'s terminology, research citations, key contributors to the field, photos and illustrations, and related aspects, commenting on the representation and consideration of diverse groups. Significant additions and revisions were made in this regard, and the review framework itself is available among the OpenStax Psychology 2e instructor resources.Art and illustrationsUnder the guidance of the authors and expert scientific illustrators, especially those well versed in creating accessible art, the OpenStax team made changes throughout the art program in Psychology 2e.Accessibility improvementsAs with all OpenStax books, the first edition of Psychology was created with a focus on accessibility. We have emphasized and improved that approach in the second edition. Our goal is to ensure that all OpenStax websites and the web view versions of our learning materials follow accessible web design best practices, so that they will meet the W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 at Level AA and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. The WCAG 2.0 guidelines explain ways to make web content more accessible for people with disabilities and more user-friendly for everyone.To accommodate users of specific assistive technologies, all alternative text was reviewed and revised for comprehensiveness and clarity.- All illustrations were revised to improve the color contrast, which is important for some visually impaired students.Overall, the OpenStax platform has been continually upgraded to improve accessibility.To learn more about our commitment and progress, please view our accessibility statement (https://openstax.org/accessibility-statement).A transition guide will be available on openstax.org to highlight the specific chapter-level changes to the second edition.Pedagogical foundationPsychology 2e engages students through inquiry, self-reflection, and investigation. Features in the second edition have been carefully updated to remain topical and relevant while deepening students\\' relationship to the material. They include the following:- Everyday Connection features tie psychological topics to everyday issues and behaviors that students encounter in their lives and the world. Topics include the validity of scores on college entrance exams, the opioid crisis, the impact of social status on stress and healthcare, and cognitive mapping.What Do You Think? features provide research-based information and ask students their views on controversial issues. Topics include “Brain Dead and on Life Support,” “Violent Media and Aggression,” and “Capital Punishment and Criminals with Intellectual Disabilities.”Dig Deeper features discuss one specific aspect of a topic in greater depth so students can dig more deeply into the concept. Examples include discussions on the distinction between evolutionary psychology and behavioral genetics, recent findings on neuroplasticity, the field of forensic psychology, and a presentation of research on strategies for coping with prejudice and discrimination.Connect the Concepts features revisit a concept learned in another chapter, expanding upon it within a different context. Features include “Emotional Expression and Emotional Regulation,” “Tweens, Teens,\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 15.0, \\'id\\': 34.0}, page_content=\\'4 Prefaceand Social Norms,\" and \"Conditioning and OCD.\"Art, interactives, and assessments that engageOur art program is designed to enhance students\\\\\\' understanding of psychological concepts through simple, effective graphs, diagrams, and photographs.

However, we can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus, psychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.In general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot arrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the mind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific method is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on observation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or previous authorities.It was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this time, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is, at its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological organism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore, psychology is also a social science.WHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?Often, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to learn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course because it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as nursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare psychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses across the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology majors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook\\'s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality and political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About 6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S. Department of Education, 2016).Access for free at openstax.org\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 13.0, \\'id\\': 36.0}, page_content=\"2 Prefacestudies and current and emerging research.

Some chapters were significantly updated for conceptual coverage, research-informed data, and clearer language. In other chapters, the revisions focused mostly on currency of examples and updates to statistics.Over 210 new research references have been added or updated in order to improve the scholarly underpinnings of the material and broaden the perspective for students. Dozens of examples and feature boxes have been changed or added to better explain concepts and/or increase relevance for students.Research replication and validityTo engage students in stronger critical analysis and inform them about research reproducibility, substantial coverage has been added to the research chapter and strategically throughout the textbook whenever keyAccess for free at openstax.org\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/What Is Psychology?\\', \\'page_num\\': 8.0, \\'id\\': 27.0}, page_content=\\'Critical Thinking Questions 246\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 246CHAPTER 8Memory 247\\\\nIntroduction 247\\\\n8.1 How Memory Functions 248\\\\n8.2 Parts of the Brain Involved with Memory 255\\\\n8.3 Problems with Memory 259\\\\n8.4 Ways to Enhance Memory 269\\\\nKey Terms 273\\\\nSummary 274\\\\nReview Questions 275\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 276\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 277CHAPTER 9Lifespan Development 279\\\\nIntroduction 279\\\\n9.1 What Is Lifespan Development? 280\\\\n9.2 Lifespan Theories 284\\\\n9.3 Stages of Development 292\\\\n9.4 Death and Dying 313\\\\nKey Terms 315\\\\nSummary 316\\\\nReview Questions 317\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 319\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 320CHAPTER 10\\\\nEmotion and Motivation\\\\n321\\\\nIntroduction 321\\\\n10.1 Motivation 322\\\\n10.2 Hunger and Eating 328\\\\n10.3 Sexual Behavior 334\\\\n10.4 Emotion 342\\\\nKey Terms 353\\\\nSummary 354\\\\nReview Questions 355\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 357\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 357CHAPTER 11\\\\nPersonality 359Introduction 359\\\\n11.1 What Is Personality? 360\\\\n11.2 Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective 362\\\\n11.3 Neo-Freudians: Adler, Erikson, Jung, andorney 368\\\\n11.4 Learning Approaches 373\\\\n11.5 Humanistic Approaches 377\\\\n11.6 Biological Approaches 378\\'), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 12.0, \\'id\\': 26.0}, page_content=\"Preface 1PrefaceWelcome to Psychology 2e, an OpenStax resource.

This material is presented in a balanced way and provides instructors with ample opportunity to discuss the importance of replication in a manner that best suits their course.Diversity, representation, and inclusionWith the help of researchers and teachers who focus on diversity- and identity-related issues, OpenStax has engaged in detailed diversity reviews to identify opportunities to improve the textbook. Reviewers were asked to follow a framework to evaluate the book\\'s terminology, research citations, key contributors to the field, photos and illustrations, and related aspects, commenting on the representation and consideration of diverse groups. Significant additions and revisions were made in this regard, and the review framework itself is available among the OpenStax Psychology 2e instructor resources.Art and illustrationsUnder the guidance of the authors and expert scientific illustrators, especially those well versed in creating accessible art, the OpenStax team made changes throughout the art program in Psychology 2e.Accessibility improvementsAs with all OpenStax books, the first edition of Psychology was created with a focus on accessibility. We have emphasized and improved that approach in the second edition. Our goal is to ensure that all OpenStax websites and the web view versions of our learning materials follow accessible web design best practices, so that they will meet the W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 at Level AA and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. The WCAG 2.0 guidelines explain ways to make web content more accessible for people with disabilities and more user-friendly for everyone.To accommodate users of specific assistive technologies, all alternative text was reviewed and revised for comprehensiveness and clarity.- All illustrations were revised to improve the color contrast, which is important for some visually impaired students.Overall, the OpenStax platform has been continually upgraded to improve accessibility.To learn more about our commitment and progress, please view our accessibility statement (https://openstax.org/accessibility-statement).A transition guide will be available on openstax.org to highlight the specific chapter-level changes to the second edition.Pedagogical foundationPsychology 2e engages students through inquiry, self-reflection, and investigation. Features in the second edition have been carefully updated to remain topical and relevant while deepening students\\' relationship to the material. They include the following:- Everyday Connection features tie psychological topics to everyday issues and behaviors that students encounter in their lives and the world. Topics include the validity of scores on college entrance exams, the opioid crisis, the impact of social status on stress and healthcare, and cognitive mapping.What Do You Think? features provide research-based information and ask students their views on controversial issues. Topics include “Brain Dead and on Life Support,” “Violent Media and Aggression,” and “Capital Punishment and Criminals with Intellectual Disabilities.”Dig Deeper features discuss one specific aspect of a topic in greater depth so students can dig more deeply into the concept. Examples include discussions on the distinction between evolutionary psychology and behavioral genetics, recent findings on neuroplasticity, the field of forensic psychology, and a presentation of research on strategies for coping with prejudice and discrimination.Connect the Concepts features revisit a concept learned in another chapter, expanding upon it within a different context.

Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these experiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain\\'s internal processes and people\\'s external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of psychology has explored these questions.1.1 What Is Psychology?LEARNING OBJECTIVESBy the end of this section, you will be able to:Define psychologyUnderstand the merits of an education in psychologyWhat is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology explores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists use the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question about how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the phenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or group of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over time. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes observations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then published or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.Scientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because it is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We must ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However, we can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus, psychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.In general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot arrive at knowledge about values and morality.

Reviewers were asked to follow a framework to evaluate the book\\'s terminology, research citations, key contributors to the field, photos and illustrations, and related aspects, commenting on the representation and consideration of diverse groups. Significant additions and revisions were made in this regard, and the review framework itself is available among the OpenStax Psychology 2e instructor resources.Art and illustrationsUnder the guidance of the authors and expert scientific illustrators, especially those well versed in creating accessible art, the OpenStax team made changes throughout the art program in Psychology 2e.Accessibility improvementsAs with all OpenStax books, the first edition of Psychology was created with a focus on accessibility. We have emphasized and improved that approach in the second edition. Our goal is to ensure that all OpenStax websites and the web view versions of our learning materials follow accessible web design best practices, so that they will meet the W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 at Level AA and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. The WCAG 2.0 guidelines explain ways to make web content more accessible for people with disabilities and more user-friendly for everyone.To accommodate users of specific assistive technologies, all alternative text was reviewed and revised for comprehensiveness and clarity.- All illustrations were revised to improve the color contrast, which is important for some visually impaired students.Overall, the OpenStax platform has been continually upgraded to improve accessibility.To learn more about our commitment and progress, please view our accessibility statement (https://openstax.org/accessibility-statement).A transition guide will be available on openstax.org to highlight the specific chapter-level changes to the second edition.Pedagogical foundationPsychology 2e engages students through inquiry, self-reflection, and investigation. Features in the second edition have been carefully updated to remain topical and relevant while deepening students\\' relationship to the material. They include the following:- Everyday Connection features tie psychological topics to everyday issues and behaviors that students encounter in their lives and the world. Topics include the validity of scores on college entrance exams, the opioid crisis, the impact of social status on stress and healthcare, and cognitive mapping.What Do You Think? features provide research-based information and ask students their views on controversial issues. Topics include “Brain Dead and on Life Support,” “Violent Media and Aggression,” and “Capital Punishment and Criminals with Intellectual Disabilities.”Dig Deeper features discuss one specific aspect of a topic in greater depth so students can dig more deeply into the concept. Examples include discussions on the distinction between evolutionary psychology and behavioral genetics, recent findings on neuroplasticity, the field of forensic psychology, and a presentation of research on strategies for coping with prejudice and discrimination.Connect the Concepts features revisit a concept learned in another chapter, expanding upon it within a different context. Features include “Emotional Expression and Emotional Regulation,” “Tweens, Teens,\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 17.0, \\'id\\': 33.0}, page_content=\\'6 PrefaceChristine Selby, Husson University\\\\nSally B.

James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is associated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend\\\\\\'s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John Nash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would tell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended for him. He also began to hear voices and became suspicious of the people around him. Soon thereafter, Nash was diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to a state-run mental institution (O\\\\\\'Connor & Robertson,\\'), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/Contemporary Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 19.0, \\'id\\': 30.0}, page_content=\"8 1 Introduction to Psychology2002). Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these experiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain\\'s internal processes and people\\'s external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of psychology has explored these questions.1.1 What Is Psychology?LEARNING OBJECTIVESBy the end of this section, you will be able to:Define psychologyUnderstand the merits of an education in psychologyWhat is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology explores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists use the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question about how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the phenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or group of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over time. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes observations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then published or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.Scientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because it is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We must ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However, we can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus, psychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.In general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot arrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the mind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific method is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on observation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or previous authorities.It was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this time, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is, at its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological organism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore, psychology is also a social science.WHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?Often, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to learn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course because it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as nursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare psychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses across the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology majors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook\\'s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality and political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About 6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S. Department of Education, 2016).Access for free at openstax.org\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 13.0, \\'id\\': 36.0}, page_content=\"2 Prefacestudies and current and emerging research. The text also includes coverage of the DSM-5 in examinations of psychological disorders. Psychology 2e incorporates discussions that reflect the diversity within the discipline, as well as the diversity of cultures and communities across the globe.Coverage and scopeThe first edition of Psychology has been used by thousands of faculty and hundreds of thousands of students since its publication in 2015. OpenStax mined our adopters\\' extensive and helpful feedback to identify the most significant revision needs while maintaining the organization that many instructors had incorporated into their courses. Specific surveys, pre-revision reviews, and customization analysis, as well as analytical data from OpenStax partners and online learning environments, all aided in planning the revision.The result is a book that thoroughly treats psychology\\'s foundational concepts while adding current and meaningful coverage in specific areas. Psychology 2e retains its manageable scope and contains ample features to draw learners into the discipline.Structurally, the textbook remains similar to the first edition, with no chapter reorganization and very targeted changes at the section level.Chapter 1: Introduction to PsychologyChapter 2: Psychological ResearchChapter 3: BiopsychologyChapter 4: States of ConsciousnessChapter 5: Sensation and PerceptionChapter 6: LearningChapter 7: Thinking and IntelligenceChapter 8: MemoryChapter 9: Lifespan DevelopmentChapter 10: Motivation and EmotionChapter 11: PersonalityChapter 12: Social PsychologyChapter 13: Industrial-Organizational PsychologyChapter 14: Stress, Lifestyle, and HealthChapter 15: Psychological DisordersChapter 16: Therapy and TreatmentChanges to the Second EditionOpenStax only undertakes second editions when significant modifications to the text are necessary. In the case of Psychology 2e, user feedback indicated that we needed to focus on a few key areas, which we have done in the following ways.Content revisions for clarity, accuracy, and currencyThe revision plan varied by chapter based on need. Some chapters were significantly updated for conceptual coverage, research-informed data, and clearer language. In other chapters, the revisions focused mostly on currency of examples and updates to statistics.Over 210 new research references have been added or updated in order to improve the scholarly underpinnings of the material and broaden the perspective for students. Dozens of examples and feature boxes have been changed or added to better explain concepts and/or increase relevance for students.Research replication and validityTo engage students in stronger critical analysis and inform them about research reproducibility, substantial coverage has been added to the research chapter and strategically throughout the textbook whenever keyAccess for free at openstax.org\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 15.0, \\'id\\': 34.0}, page_content=\\'4 Prefaceand Social Norms,\" and \"Conditioning and OCD.\"Art, interactives, and assessments that engageOur art program is designed to enhance students\\\\\\' understanding of psychological concepts through simple, effective graphs, diagrams, and photographs.

Significant additions and revisions were made in this regard, and the review framework itself is available among the OpenStax Psychology 2e instructor resources.Art and illustrationsUnder the guidance of the authors and expert scientific illustrators, especially those well versed in creating accessible art, the OpenStax team made changes throughout the art program in Psychology 2e.Accessibility improvementsAs with all OpenStax books, the first edition of Psychology was created with a focus on accessibility. We have emphasized and improved that approach in the second edition. Our goal is to ensure that all OpenStax websites and the web view versions of our learning materials follow accessible web design best practices, so that they will meet the W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 at Level AA and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. The WCAG 2.0 guidelines explain ways to make web content more accessible for people with disabilities and more user-friendly for everyone.To accommodate users of specific assistive technologies, all alternative text was reviewed and revised for comprehensiveness and clarity.- All illustrations were revised to improve the color contrast, which is important for some visually impaired students.Overall, the OpenStax platform has been continually upgraded to improve accessibility.To learn more about our commitment and progress, please view our accessibility statement (https://openstax.org/accessibility-statement).A transition guide will be available on openstax.org to highlight the specific chapter-level changes to the second edition.Pedagogical foundationPsychology 2e engages students through inquiry, self-reflection, and investigation. Features in the second edition have been carefully updated to remain topical and relevant while deepening students\\' relationship to the material. They include the following:- Everyday Connection features tie psychological topics to everyday issues and behaviors that students encounter in their lives and the world. Topics include the validity of scores on college entrance exams, the opioid crisis, the impact of social status on stress and healthcare, and cognitive mapping.What Do You Think? features provide research-based information and ask students their views on controversial issues. Topics include “Brain Dead and on Life Support,” “Violent Media and Aggression,” and “Capital Punishment and Criminals with Intellectual Disabilities.”Dig Deeper features discuss one specific aspect of a topic in greater depth so students can dig more deeply into the concept. Examples include discussions on the distinction between evolutionary psychology and behavioral genetics, recent findings on neuroplasticity, the field of forensic psychology, and a presentation of research on strategies for coping with prejudice and discrimination.Connect the Concepts features revisit a concept learned in another chapter, expanding upon it within a different context.

Psychology 2e incorporates discussions that reflect the diversity within the discipline, as well as the diversity of cultures and communities across the globe.Coverage and scopeThe first edition of Psychology has been used by thousands of faculty and hundreds of thousands of students since its publication in 2015. OpenStax mined our adopters\\' extensive and helpful feedback to identify the most significant revision needs while maintaining the organization that many instructors had incorporated into their courses. Specific surveys, pre-revision reviews, and customization analysis, as well as analytical data from OpenStax partners and online learning environments, all aided in planning the revision.The result is a book that thoroughly treats psychology\\'s foundational concepts while adding current and meaningful coverage in specific areas. Psychology 2e retains its manageable scope and contains ample features to draw learners into the discipline.Structurally, the textbook remains similar to the first edition, with no chapter reorganization and very targeted changes at the section level.Chapter 1: Introduction to PsychologyChapter 2: Psychological ResearchChapter 3: BiopsychologyChapter 4: States of ConsciousnessChapter 5: Sensation and PerceptionChapter 6: LearningChapter 7: Thinking and IntelligenceChapter 8: MemoryChapter 9: Lifespan DevelopmentChapter 10: Motivation and EmotionChapter 11: PersonalityChapter 12: Social PsychologyChapter 13: Industrial-Organizational PsychologyChapter 14: Stress, Lifestyle, and HealthChapter 15: Psychological DisordersChapter 16: Therapy and TreatmentChanges to the Second EditionOpenStax only undertakes second editions when significant modifications to the text are necessary. In the case of Psychology 2e, user feedback indicated that we needed to focus on a few key areas, which we have done in the following ways.Content revisions for clarity, accuracy, and currencyThe revision plan varied by chapter based on need. Some chapters were significantly updated for conceptual coverage, research-informed data, and clearer language. In other chapters, the revisions focused mostly on currency of examples and updates to statistics.Over 210 new research references have been added or updated in order to improve the scholarly underpinnings of the material and broaden the perspective for students. Dozens of examples and feature boxes have been changed or added to better explain concepts and/or increase relevance for students.Research replication and validityTo engage students in stronger critical analysis and inform them about research reproducibility, substantial coverage has been added to the research chapter and strategically throughout the textbook whenever keyAccess for free at openstax.org\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 15.0, \\'id\\': 34.0}, page_content=\\'4 Prefaceand Social Norms,\" and \"Conditioning and OCD.\"Art, interactives, and assessments that engageOur art program is designed to enhance students\\\\\\' understanding of psychological concepts through simple, effective graphs, diagrams, and photographs.

Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these experiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain\\'s internal processes and people\\'s external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of psychology has explored these questions.1.1 What Is Psychology?LEARNING OBJECTIVESBy the end of this section, you will be able to:Define psychologyUnderstand the merits of an education in psychologyWhat is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology explores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists use the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question about how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the phenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or group of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over time. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes observations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then published or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.Scientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because it is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We must ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However, we can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus, psychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.In general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot arrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the mind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific method is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on observation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or previous authorities.It was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this time, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is, at its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological organism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore, psychology is also a social science.WHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?Often, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to learn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course because it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as nursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare psychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses across the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology majors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook\\'s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality and political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About 6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S. Department of Education, 2016).Access for free at openstax.org\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 17.0, \\'id\\': 33.0}, page_content=\\'6 PrefaceChristine Selby, Husson University\\\\nSally B.

While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember what he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is associated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend\\\\\\'s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John Nash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would tell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended for him. He also began to hear voices and became suspicious of the people around him. Soon thereafter, Nash was diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to a state-run mental institution (O\\\\\\'Connor & Robertson,\\'), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 12.0, \\'id\\': 26.0}, page_content=\"Preface 1PrefaceWelcome to Psychology 2e, an OpenStax resource.

Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these experiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain\\'s internal processes and people\\'s external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of psychology has explored these questions.1.1 What Is Psychology?LEARNING OBJECTIVESBy the end of this section, you will be able to:Define psychologyUnderstand the merits of an education in psychologyWhat is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology explores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists use the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question about how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the phenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or group of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over time. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes observations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then published or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.Scientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because it is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We must ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However, we can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus, psychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.In general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot arrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the mind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific method is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on observation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or previous authorities.It was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this time, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is, at its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological organism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore, psychology is also a social science.WHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?Often, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to learn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course because it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as nursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare psychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses across the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology majors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook\\'s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality and political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About 6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S. Department of Education, 2016).Access for free at openstax.org\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 13.0, \\'id\\': 36.0}, page_content=\"2 Prefacestudies and current and emerging research.

Psychology 2e incorporates discussions that reflect the diversity within the discipline, as well as the diversity of cultures and communities across the globe.Coverage and scopeThe first edition of Psychology has been used by thousands of faculty and hundreds of thousands of students since its publication in 2015. OpenStax mined our adopters\\' extensive and helpful feedback to identify the most significant revision needs while maintaining the organization that many instructors had incorporated into their courses. Specific surveys, pre-revision reviews, and customization analysis, as well as analytical data from OpenStax partners and online learning environments, all aided in planning the revision.The result is a book that thoroughly treats psychology\\'s foundational concepts while adding current and meaningful coverage in specific areas. Psychology 2e retains its manageable scope and contains ample features to draw learners into the discipline.Structurally, the textbook remains similar to the first edition, with no chapter reorganization and very targeted changes at the section level.Chapter 1: Introduction to PsychologyChapter 2: Psychological ResearchChapter 3: BiopsychologyChapter 4: States of ConsciousnessChapter 5: Sensation and PerceptionChapter 6: LearningChapter 7: Thinking and IntelligenceChapter 8: MemoryChapter 9: Lifespan DevelopmentChapter 10: Motivation and EmotionChapter 11: PersonalityChapter 12: Social PsychologyChapter 13: Industrial-Organizational PsychologyChapter 14: Stress, Lifestyle, and HealthChapter 15: Psychological DisordersChapter 16: Therapy and TreatmentChanges to the Second EditionOpenStax only undertakes second editions when significant modifications to the text are necessary. In the case of Psychology 2e, user feedback indicated that we needed to focus on a few key areas, which we have done in the following ways.Content revisions for clarity, accuracy, and currencyThe revision plan varied by chapter based on need. Some chapters were significantly updated for conceptual coverage, research-informed data, and clearer language. In other chapters, the revisions focused mostly on currency of examples and updates to statistics.Over 210 new research references have been added or updated in order to improve the scholarly underpinnings of the material and broaden the perspective for students. Dozens of examples and feature boxes have been changed or added to better explain concepts and/or increase relevance for students.Research replication and validityTo engage students in stronger critical analysis and inform them about research reproducibility, substantial coverage has been added to the research chapter and strategically throughout the textbook whenever keyAccess for free at openstax.org\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/What Is Psychology?\\', \\'page_num\\': 8.0, \\'id\\': 27.0}, page_content=\\'Critical Thinking Questions 246\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 246CHAPTER 8Memory 247\\\\nIntroduction 247\\\\n8.1 How Memory Functions 248\\\\n8.2 Parts of the Brain Involved with Memory 255\\\\n8.3 Problems with Memory 259\\\\n8.4 Ways to Enhance Memory 269\\\\nKey Terms 273\\\\nSummary 274\\\\nReview Questions 275\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 276\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 277CHAPTER 9Lifespan Development 279\\\\nIntroduction 279\\\\n9.1 What Is Lifespan Development? 280\\\\n9.2 Lifespan Theories 284\\\\n9.3 Stages of Development 292\\\\n9.4 Death and Dying 313\\\\nKey Terms 315\\\\nSummary 316\\\\nReview Questions 317\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 319\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 320CHAPTER 10\\\\nEmotion and Motivation\\\\n321\\\\nIntroduction 321\\\\n10.1 Motivation 322\\\\n10.2 Hunger and Eating 328\\\\n10.3 Sexual Behavior 334\\\\n10.4 Emotion 342\\\\nKey Terms 353\\\\nSummary 354\\\\nReview Questions 355\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 357\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 357CHAPTER 11\\\\nPersonality 359Introduction 359\\\\n11.1 What Is Personality? 360\\\\n11.2 Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective 362\\\\n11.3 Neo-Freudians: Adler, Erikson, Jung, andorney 368\\\\n11.4 Learning Approaches 373\\\\n11.5 Humanistic Approaches 377\\\\n11.6 Biological Approaches 378\\'), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 17.0, \\'id\\': 33.0}, page_content=\\'6 PrefaceChristine Selby, Husson University\\\\nSally B.

This material is presented in a balanced way and provides instructors with ample opportunity to discuss the importance of replication in a manner that best suits their course.Diversity, representation, and inclusionWith the help of researchers and teachers who focus on diversity- and identity-related issues, OpenStax has engaged in detailed diversity reviews to identify opportunities to improve the textbook. Reviewers were asked to follow a framework to evaluate the book\\'s terminology, research citations, key contributors to the field, photos and illustrations, and related aspects, commenting on the representation and consideration of diverse groups. Significant additions and revisions were made in this regard, and the review framework itself is available among the OpenStax Psychology 2e instructor resources.Art and illustrationsUnder the guidance of the authors and expert scientific illustrators, especially those well versed in creating accessible art, the OpenStax team made changes throughout the art program in Psychology 2e.Accessibility improvementsAs with all OpenStax books, the first edition of Psychology was created with a focus on accessibility. We have emphasized and improved that approach in the second edition. Our goal is to ensure that all OpenStax websites and the web view versions of our learning materials follow accessible web design best practices, so that they will meet the W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 at Level AA and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. The WCAG 2.0 guidelines explain ways to make web content more accessible for people with disabilities and more user-friendly for everyone.To accommodate users of specific assistive technologies, all alternative text was reviewed and revised for comprehensiveness and clarity.- All illustrations were revised to improve the color contrast, which is important for some visually impaired students.Overall, the OpenStax platform has been continually upgraded to improve accessibility.To learn more about our commitment and progress, please view our accessibility statement (https://openstax.org/accessibility-statement).A transition guide will be available on openstax.org to highlight the specific chapter-level changes to the second edition.Pedagogical foundationPsychology 2e engages students through inquiry, self-reflection, and investigation. Features in the second edition have been carefully updated to remain topical and relevant while deepening students\\' relationship to the material. They include the following:- Everyday Connection features tie psychological topics to everyday issues and behaviors that students encounter in their lives and the world. Topics include the validity of scores on college entrance exams, the opioid crisis, the impact of social status on stress and healthcare, and cognitive mapping.What Do You Think? features provide research-based information and ask students their views on controversial issues. Topics include “Brain Dead and on Life Support,” “Violent Media and Aggression,” and “Capital Punishment and Criminals with Intellectual Disabilities.”Dig Deeper features discuss one specific aspect of a topic in greater depth so students can dig more deeply into the concept. Examples include discussions on the distinction between evolutionary psychology and behavioral genetics, recent findings on neuroplasticity, the field of forensic psychology, and a presentation of research on strategies for coping with prejudice and discrimination.Connect the Concepts features revisit a concept learned in another chapter, expanding upon it within a different context. Features include “Emotional Expression and Emotional Regulation,” “Tweens, Teens,\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 10.0, \\'id\\': 31.0}, page_content=\\'CHAPTER 15\\\\nPsychological Disorders 537<table><tr><td>Introduction</td><td>537</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>15.1 What Are Psychological Disorders?</td><td>538</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>15.2 Diagnosing and Classifying Psychological Disorders</td><td>542</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>15.3 Perspectives on Psychological Disorders</td><td>545</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>15.4 Anxiety Disorders</td><td>548</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>15.5 Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders</td><td>554</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>15.6 Posttraumatic Stress Disorder</td><td>558</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>15.7 Mood and Related Disorders</td><td>560</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>15.8 Schizophrenia</td><td>570</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>15.9 Dissociative Disorders</td><td>574</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>15.10 Disorders in Childhood</td><td>576</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>15.11 Personality Disorders</td><td>582</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Key Terms</td><td>589</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Summary</td><td>591</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Review Questions</td><td>594</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Critical Thinking Questions</td><td>597</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Personal Application Questions</td><td>598</td><td></td></tr></table>CHAPTER 16\\\\nTherapy and Treatment 599<table><tr><td>Introduction</td><td>599</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>16.1 Mental Health Treatment: Past and Present</td><td>600</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>16.2 Types of Treatment</td><td>605</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>16.3 Treatment Modalities</td><td>617</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>16.4 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders: A Special Case</td><td></td><td>621</td></tr><tr><td>16.5 The Sociocultural Model and Therapy Utilization</td><td>623</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Key Terms</td><td>627</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Summary</td><td>628</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Review Questions</td><td>630</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Critical Thinking Questions</td><td>632</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Personal Application Questions</td><td>632</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>References</td><td>633</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Index</td><td>733</td><td></td></tr></table>\\'), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/Contemporary Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 18.0, \\'id\\': 29.0}, page_content=\\'1Introduction to PsychologyFIGURE 1.1 Psychology is the scientific study of mind and behavior.

An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on observation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or previous authorities.It was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this time, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is, at its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological organism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore, psychology is also a social science.WHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?Often, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to learn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course because it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as nursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare psychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses across the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology majors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook\\'s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality and political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About 6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S. Department of Education, 2016).Access for free at openstax.org\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 13.0, \\'id\\': 36.0}, page_content=\"2 Prefacestudies and current and emerging research.

We have emphasized and improved that approach in the second edition. Our goal is to ensure that all OpenStax websites and the web view versions of our learning materials follow accessible web design best practices, so that they will meet the W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 at Level AA and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. The WCAG 2.0 guidelines explain ways to make web content more accessible for people with disabilities and more user-friendly for everyone.To accommodate users of specific assistive technologies, all alternative text was reviewed and revised for comprehensiveness and clarity.- All illustrations were revised to improve the color contrast, which is important for some visually impaired students.Overall, the OpenStax platform has been continually upgraded to improve accessibility.To learn more about our commitment and progress, please view our accessibility statement (https://openstax.org/accessibility-statement).A transition guide will be available on openstax.org to highlight the specific chapter-level changes to the second edition.Pedagogical foundationPsychology 2e engages students through inquiry, self-reflection, and investigation. Features in the second edition have been carefully updated to remain topical and relevant while deepening students\\' relationship to the material. They include the following:- Everyday Connection features tie psychological topics to everyday issues and behaviors that students encounter in their lives and the world. Topics include the validity of scores on college entrance exams, the opioid crisis, the impact of social status on stress and healthcare, and cognitive mapping.What Do You Think? features provide research-based information and ask students their views on controversial issues. Topics include “Brain Dead and on Life Support,” “Violent Media and Aggression,” and “Capital Punishment and Criminals with Intellectual Disabilities.”Dig Deeper features discuss one specific aspect of a topic in greater depth so students can dig more deeply into the concept. Examples include discussions on the distinction between evolutionary psychology and behavioral genetics, recent findings on neuroplasticity, the field of forensic psychology, and a presentation of research on strategies for coping with prejudice and discrimination.Connect the Concepts features revisit a concept learned in another chapter, expanding upon it within a different context. Features include “Emotional Expression and Emotional Regulation,” “Tweens, Teens,\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 9.0, \\'id\\': 28.0}, page_content=\\'11.7 Trait Theorists 379\\\\n11.8 Cultural Understandings of Personality 384\\\\n11.9 Personality Assessment 386\\\\nKey Terms 391\\\\nSummary 392\\\\nReview Questions 394\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 397\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 397CHAPTER 12\\\\nSocial Psychology 399Introduction 399\\\\n12.1 What Is Social Psychology? 400\\\\n12.2 Self-presentation 406\\\\n12.3 Attitudes and Persuasion 409\\\\n12.4 Conformity, Compliance, and Obedience 415\\\\n12.5 Prejudice and Discrimination 422\\\\n12.6 Aggression 429\\\\n12.7 Prosocial Behavior 432\\\\nKey Terms 437\\\\nSummary 439\\\\nReview Questions 440\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 444\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 444CHAPTER 13\\\\nIndustrial-Organizational PsychologyIntroduction 447\\\\n13.1 What Is Industrial and Organizational Psychology? 448\\\\n13.2 Industrial Psychology: Selecting and Evaluating Employees 456\\\\n13.3 Organizational Psychology: The Social Dimension of Work 467\\\\n13.4 Human Factors Psychology and Workplace Design 477\\\\nKey Terms 480\\\\nSummary 481\\\\nReview Questions 481\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 483\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 484CHAPTER 14 Stress, Lifestyle, and HealthIntroduction 485\\\\n14.1 What Is Stress? 486\\\\n14.2 Stressors 496\\\\n14.3 Stress and Illness 502\\\\n14.4 Regulation of Stress 514\\\\n14.5 The Pursuit of Happiness 521\\\\nKey Terms 529\\\\nSummary 530\\\\nReview Questions 531\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 534\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 535Access for free at openstax.org\\'), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 17.0, \\'id\\': 33.0}, page_content=\\'6 PrefaceChristine Selby, Husson University\\\\nSally B.

While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember what he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is associated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend\\\\\\'s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John Nash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would tell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended for him. He also began to hear voices and became suspicious of the people around him. Soon thereafter, Nash was diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to a state-run mental institution (O\\\\\\'Connor & Robertson,\\'), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/Contemporary Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 19.0, \\'id\\': 30.0}, page_content=\"8 1 Introduction to Psychology2002). Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these experiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain\\'s internal processes and people\\'s external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of psychology has explored these questions.1.1 What Is Psychology?LEARNING OBJECTIVESBy the end of this section, you will be able to:Define psychologyUnderstand the merits of an education in psychologyWhat is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology explores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists use the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question about how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the phenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or group of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over time. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes observations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then published or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.Scientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because it is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We must ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However, we can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus, psychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.In general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot arrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the mind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific method is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on observation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or previous authorities.It was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this time, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is, at its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological organism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore, psychology is also a social science.WHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?Often, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to learn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course because it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as nursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare psychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses across the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology majors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook\\'s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality and political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011).

This material is presented in a balanced way and provides instructors with ample opportunity to discuss the importance of replication in a manner that best suits their course.Diversity, representation, and inclusionWith the help of researchers and teachers who focus on diversity- and identity-related issues, OpenStax has engaged in detailed diversity reviews to identify opportunities to improve the textbook. Reviewers were asked to follow a framework to evaluate the book\\'s terminology, research citations, key contributors to the field, photos and illustrations, and related aspects, commenting on the representation and consideration of diverse groups. Significant additions and revisions were made in this regard, and the review framework itself is available among the OpenStax Psychology 2e instructor resources.Art and illustrationsUnder the guidance of the authors and expert scientific illustrators, especially those well versed in creating accessible art, the OpenStax team made changes throughout the art program in Psychology 2e.Accessibility improvementsAs with all OpenStax books, the first edition of Psychology was created with a focus on accessibility. We have emphasized and improved that approach in the second edition. Our goal is to ensure that all OpenStax websites and the web view versions of our learning materials follow accessible web design best practices, so that they will meet the W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 at Level AA and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. The WCAG 2.0 guidelines explain ways to make web content more accessible for people with disabilities and more user-friendly for everyone.To accommodate users of specific assistive technologies, all alternative text was reviewed and revised for comprehensiveness and clarity.- All illustrations were revised to improve the color contrast, which is important for some visually impaired students.Overall, the OpenStax platform has been continually upgraded to improve accessibility.To learn more about our commitment and progress, please view our accessibility statement (https://openstax.org/accessibility-statement).A transition guide will be available on openstax.org to highlight the specific chapter-level changes to the second edition.Pedagogical foundationPsychology 2e engages students through inquiry, self-reflection, and investigation. Features in the second edition have been carefully updated to remain topical and relevant while deepening students\\' relationship to the material. They include the following:- Everyday Connection features tie psychological topics to everyday issues and behaviors that students encounter in their lives and the world. Topics include the validity of scores on college entrance exams, the opioid crisis, the impact of social status on stress and healthcare, and cognitive mapping.What Do You Think? features provide research-based information and ask students their views on controversial issues. Topics include “Brain Dead and on Life Support,” “Violent Media and Aggression,” and “Capital Punishment and Criminals with Intellectual Disabilities.”Dig Deeper features discuss one specific aspect of a topic in greater depth so students can dig more deeply into the concept. Examples include discussions on the distinction between evolutionary psychology and behavioral genetics, recent findings on neuroplasticity, the field of forensic psychology, and a presentation of research on strategies for coping with prejudice and discrimination.Connect the Concepts features revisit a concept learned in another chapter, expanding upon it within a different context. Features include “Emotional Expression and Emotional Regulation,” “Tweens, Teens,\")]'\ntype='message' id='run--f2a557a9-0d4b-4bba-b936-bd78816c5914' content=[{'text': 'Wilhelm Wundt (1832-1920) was a German philosopher and physiologist who is considered the \"father of modern psychology.\" He is best known for establishing the first laboratory of psychology in Leipzig, Germany in 1879, where he and his students conducted research on the study of the mind and behavior.

Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these experiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain\\'s internal processes and people\\'s external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of psychology has explored these questions.1.1 What Is Psychology?LEARNING OBJECTIVESBy the end of this section, you will be able to:Define psychologyUnderstand the merits of an education in psychologyWhat is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology explores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists use the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question about how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the phenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or group of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over time. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes observations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then published or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.Scientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because it is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We must ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However, we can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus, psychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.In general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot arrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the mind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific method is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on observation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or previous authorities.It was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this time, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is, at its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological organism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore, psychology is also a social science.WHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?Often, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to learn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course because it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as nursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare psychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses across the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology majors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook\\'s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality and political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About 6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S. Department of Education, 2016).Access for free at openstax.org\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/What Is Psychology?\\', \\'page_num\\': 8.0, \\'id\\': 27.0}, page_content=\\'Critical Thinking Questions 246\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 246CHAPTER 8Memory 247\\\\nIntroduction 247\\\\n8.1 How Memory Functions 248\\\\n8.2 Parts of the Brain Involved with Memory 255\\\\n8.3 Problems with Memory 259\\\\n8.4 Ways to Enhance Memory 269\\\\nKey Terms 273\\\\nSummary 274\\\\nReview Questions 275\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 276\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 277CHAPTER 9Lifespan Development 279\\\\nIntroduction 279\\\\n9.1 What Is Lifespan Development? 280\\\\n9.2 Lifespan Theories 284\\\\n9.3 Stages of Development 292\\\\n9.4 Death and Dying 313\\\\nKey Terms 315\\\\nSummary 316\\\\nReview Questions 317\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 319\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 320CHAPTER 10\\\\nEmotion and Motivation\\\\n321\\\\nIntroduction 321\\\\n10.1 Motivation 322\\\\n10.2 Hunger and Eating 328\\\\n10.3 Sexual Behavior 334\\\\n10.4 Emotion 342\\\\nKey Terms 353\\\\nSummary 354\\\\nReview Questions 355\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 357\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 357CHAPTER 11\\\\nPersonality 359Introduction 359\\\\n11.1 What Is Personality? 360\\\\n11.2 Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective 362\\\\n11.3 Neo-Freudians: Adler, Erikson, Jung, andorney 368\\\\n11.4 Learning Approaches 373\\\\n11.5 Humanistic Approaches 377\\\\n11.6 Biological Approaches 378\\'), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 13.0, \\'id\\': 36.0}, page_content=\"2 Prefacestudies and current and emerging research.

OpenStax mined our adopters\\' extensive and helpful feedback to identify the most significant revision needs while maintaining the organization that many instructors had incorporated into their courses. Specific surveys, pre-revision reviews, and customization analysis, as well as analytical data from OpenStax partners and online learning environments, all aided in planning the revision.The result is a book that thoroughly treats psychology\\'s foundational concepts while adding current and meaningful coverage in specific areas. Psychology 2e retains its manageable scope and contains ample features to draw learners into the discipline.Structurally, the textbook remains similar to the first edition, with no chapter reorganization and very targeted changes at the section level.Chapter 1: Introduction to PsychologyChapter 2: Psychological ResearchChapter 3: BiopsychologyChapter 4: States of ConsciousnessChapter 5: Sensation and PerceptionChapter 6: LearningChapter 7: Thinking and IntelligenceChapter 8: MemoryChapter 9: Lifespan DevelopmentChapter 10: Motivation and EmotionChapter 11: PersonalityChapter 12: Social PsychologyChapter 13: Industrial-Organizational PsychologyChapter 14: Stress, Lifestyle, and HealthChapter 15: Psychological DisordersChapter 16: Therapy and TreatmentChanges to the Second EditionOpenStax only undertakes second editions when significant modifications to the text are necessary.

Some chapters were significantly updated for conceptual coverage, research-informed data, and clearer language. In other chapters, the revisions focused mostly on currency of examples and updates to statistics.Over 210 new research references have been added or updated in order to improve the scholarly underpinnings of the material and broaden the perspective for students. Dozens of examples and feature boxes have been changed or added to better explain concepts and/or increase relevance for students.Research replication and validityTo engage students in stronger critical analysis and inform them about research reproducibility, substantial coverage has been added to the research chapter and strategically throughout the textbook whenever keyAccess for free at openstax.org\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/Contemporary Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 18.0, \\'id\\': 29.0}, page_content=\\'1Introduction to PsychologyFIGURE 1.1 Psychology is the scientific study of mind and behavior.

While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember what he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is associated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend\\\\\\'s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John Nash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would tell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended for him.

The main idea is that the mind is an active and creative process that shapes and reconstructs our perceptions and experiences to maintain a sense of continuity and coherence.\\n\\nFunctionalism emphasizes the role of consciousness and experience in shaping behavior and cognition. It argues that our experiences and perceptions are not passive reflections of the external world, but rather active constructions of our minds.\\n\\nFunctionalism also focuses on the role of purpose and function in understanding behavior and cognition.

The mind is an active and dynamic system that constructs and shapes our experiences.\\n2. Consciousness and experience are central to understanding behavior and cognition.\\n3.

Some of his key contributions include:\\n\\n1. The concept of the unconscious mind: Freud believed that the unconscious mind plays a crucial role in shaping behavior, with thoughts, feelings, and memories outside of conscious awareness influencing our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.\\n2. Psychoanalytic theory: Freud's psychoanalytic theory posits that psychological distress and psychopathology result from unconscious thoughts, memories, and desires. He developed techniques such as free association, dream analysis, and transference to help patients explore their unconscious conflicts.\\n3. Child development theory: Freud's theory of child development proposes that human development occurs in stages, with each stage characterized by a specific set of psychosexual conflicts and challenges. His theory has been influential in shaping understanding of child development and parenting.\\n4. Technique: Freud developed several techniques, including free association, dream analysis, and transference, which are still used today in psychotherapy.\\n5. The concept of the Oedipus complex: Freud's theory of the Oedipus complex proposes that children experience unconscious desires for the opposite-sex parent, leading to feelings of guilt, shame, and anxiety.\\n\\nOverall, Freud's contributions have had a profound impact on our understanding of the human mind, behavior, and psychological development.\", 'type': 'output_text'}] role='assistant'\nQuery 14\n[NOTICE] Using a notebook authentication token.

Psychology 2e incorporates discussions that reflect the diversity within the discipline, as well as the diversity of cultures and communities across the globe.Coverage and scopeThe first edition of Psychology has been used by thousands of faculty and hundreds of thousands of students since its publication in 2015. OpenStax mined our adopters\\' extensive and helpful feedback to identify the most significant revision needs while maintaining the organization that many instructors had incorporated into their courses. Specific surveys, pre-revision reviews, and customization analysis, as well as analytical data from OpenStax partners and online learning environments, all aided in planning the revision.The result is a book that thoroughly treats psychology\\'s foundational concepts while adding current and meaningful coverage in specific areas. Psychology 2e retains its manageable scope and contains ample features to draw learners into the discipline.Structurally, the textbook remains similar to the first edition, with no chapter reorganization and very targeted changes at the section level.Chapter 1: Introduction to PsychologyChapter 2: Psychological ResearchChapter 3: BiopsychologyChapter 4: States of ConsciousnessChapter 5: Sensation and PerceptionChapter 6: LearningChapter 7: Thinking and IntelligenceChapter 8: MemoryChapter 9: Lifespan DevelopmentChapter 10: Motivation and EmotionChapter 11: PersonalityChapter 12: Social PsychologyChapter 13: Industrial-Organizational PsychologyChapter 14: Stress, Lifestyle, and HealthChapter 15: Psychological DisordersChapter 16: Therapy and TreatmentChanges to the Second EditionOpenStax only undertakes second editions when significant modifications to the text are necessary. In the case of Psychology 2e, user feedback indicated that we needed to focus on a few key areas, which we have done in the following ways.Content revisions for clarity, accuracy, and currencyThe revision plan varied by chapter based on need. Some chapters were significantly updated for conceptual coverage, research-informed data, and clearer language. In other chapters, the revisions focused mostly on currency of examples and updates to statistics.Over 210 new research references have been added or updated in order to improve the scholarly underpinnings of the material and broaden the perspective for students. Dozens of examples and feature boxes have been changed or added to better explain concepts and/or increase relevance for students.Research replication and validityTo engage students in stronger critical analysis and inform them about research reproducibility, substantial coverage has been added to the research chapter and strategically throughout the textbook whenever keyAccess for free at openstax.org\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/Contemporary Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 19.0, \\'id\\': 30.0}, page_content=\"8 1 Introduction to Psychology2002). Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these experiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain\\'s internal processes and people\\'s external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of psychology has explored these questions.1.1 What Is Psychology?LEARNING OBJECTIVESBy the end of this section, you will be able to:Define psychologyUnderstand the merits of an education in psychologyWhat is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology explores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists use the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question about how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the phenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or group of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over time. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes observations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then published or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.Scientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because it is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We must ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However, we can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus, psychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.In general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot arrive at knowledge about values and morality.

While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember what he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is associated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend\\\\\\'s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John Nash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would tell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended for him. He also began to hear voices and became suspicious of the people around him. Soon thereafter, Nash was diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to a state-run mental institution (O\\\\\\'Connor & Robertson,\\'), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/What Is Psychology?\\', \\'page_num\\': 8.0, \\'id\\': 27.0}, page_content=\\'Critical Thinking Questions 246\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 246CHAPTER 8Memory 247\\\\nIntroduction 247\\\\n8.1 How Memory Functions 248\\\\n8.2 Parts of the Brain Involved with Memory 255\\\\n8.3 Problems with Memory 259\\\\n8.4 Ways to Enhance Memory 269\\\\nKey Terms 273\\\\nSummary 274\\\\nReview Questions 275\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 276\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 277CHAPTER 9Lifespan Development 279\\\\nIntroduction 279\\\\n9.1 What Is Lifespan Development? 280\\\\n9.2 Lifespan Theories 284\\\\n9.3 Stages of Development 292\\\\n9.4 Death and Dying 313\\\\nKey Terms 315\\\\nSummary 316\\\\nReview Questions 317\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 319\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 320CHAPTER 10\\\\nEmotion and Motivation\\\\n321\\\\nIntroduction 321\\\\n10.1 Motivation 322\\\\n10.2 Hunger and Eating 328\\\\n10.3 Sexual Behavior 334\\\\n10.4 Emotion 342\\\\nKey Terms 353\\\\nSummary 354\\\\nReview Questions 355\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 357\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 357CHAPTER 11\\\\nPersonality 359Introduction 359\\\\n11.1 What Is Personality? 360\\\\n11.2 Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective 362\\\\n11.3 Neo-Freudians: Adler, Erikson, Jung, andorney 368\\\\n11.4 Learning Approaches 373\\\\n11.5 Humanistic Approaches 377\\\\n11.6 Biological Approaches 378\\'), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 17.0, \\'id\\': 33.0}, page_content=\\'6 PrefaceChristine Selby, Husson University\\\\nSally B.

They were first proposed by German psychologists Max Wertheimer, Kurt Koffka, and Wolfgang Köhler in the early 20th century. The principles include:\\n\\n1. Proximity: Objects that are close together are perceived as a group.\\n2. Similarity: Objects that are similar in size, shape, color, or other characteristics are perceived as a group.\\n3. Continuity: Our brains tend to see curves and smooth lines rather than sharp angles and pieces.\\n4. Closure: Our brains tend to fill in gaps and complete shapes, even if the information is incomplete.\\n5. Figure-Ground: The figure (object or shape) is perceived against a background (ground), but the distinction between the two can be ambiguous.\\n6. Symmetry: Objects that are symmetrical are more easily perceived than those that are not.\\n7. Prägnanz (Good Form): Our brains tend to simplify complex shapes and patterns into more basic, simple forms.\\n\\nThese principles help us make sense of the visual world by organizing and interpreting the information we receive from our senses.

Psychology 2e incorporates discussions that reflect the diversity within the discipline, as well as the diversity of cultures and communities across the globe.Coverage and scopeThe first edition of Psychology has been used by thousands of faculty and hundreds of thousands of students since its publication in 2015. OpenStax mined our adopters\\' extensive and helpful feedback to identify the most significant revision needs while maintaining the organization that many instructors had incorporated into their courses. Specific surveys, pre-revision reviews, and customization analysis, as well as analytical data from OpenStax partners and online learning environments, all aided in planning the revision.The result is a book that thoroughly treats psychology\\'s foundational concepts while adding current and meaningful coverage in specific areas. Psychology 2e retains its manageable scope and contains ample features to draw learners into the discipline.Structurally, the textbook remains similar to the first edition, with no chapter reorganization and very targeted changes at the section level.Chapter 1: Introduction to PsychologyChapter 2: Psychological ResearchChapter 3: BiopsychologyChapter 4: States of ConsciousnessChapter 5: Sensation and PerceptionChapter 6: LearningChapter 7: Thinking and IntelligenceChapter 8: MemoryChapter 9: Lifespan DevelopmentChapter 10: Motivation and EmotionChapter 11: PersonalityChapter 12: Social PsychologyChapter 13: Industrial-Organizational PsychologyChapter 14: Stress, Lifestyle, and HealthChapter 15: Psychological DisordersChapter 16: Therapy and TreatmentChanges to the Second EditionOpenStax only undertakes second editions when significant modifications to the text are necessary. In the case of Psychology 2e, user feedback indicated that we needed to focus on a few key areas, which we have done in the following ways.Content revisions for clarity, accuracy, and currencyThe revision plan varied by chapter based on need. Some chapters were significantly updated for conceptual coverage, research-informed data, and clearer language. In other chapters, the revisions focused mostly on currency of examples and updates to statistics.Over 210 new research references have been added or updated in order to improve the scholarly underpinnings of the material and broaden the perspective for students. Dozens of examples and feature boxes have been changed or added to better explain concepts and/or increase relevance for students.Research replication and validityTo engage students in stronger critical analysis and inform them about research reproducibility, substantial coverage has been added to the research chapter and strategically throughout the textbook whenever keyAccess for free at openstax.org\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/Contemporary Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 19.0, \\'id\\': 30.0}, page_content=\"8 1 Introduction to Psychology2002). Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these experiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain\\'s internal processes and people\\'s external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of psychology has explored these questions.1.1 What Is Psychology?LEARNING OBJECTIVESBy the end of this section, you will be able to:Define psychologyUnderstand the merits of an education in psychologyWhat is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology explores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists use the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question about how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the phenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or group of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over time. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes observations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then published or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.Scientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because it is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We must ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However, we can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus, psychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.In general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot arrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the mind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific method is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on observation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or previous authorities.It was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this time, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is, at its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological organism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore, psychology is also a social science.WHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?Often, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to learn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course because it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as nursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare psychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses across the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology majors.

This material is presented in a balanced way and provides instructors with ample opportunity to discuss the importance of replication in a manner that best suits their course.Diversity, representation, and inclusionWith the help of researchers and teachers who focus on diversity- and identity-related issues, OpenStax has engaged in detailed diversity reviews to identify opportunities to improve the textbook. Reviewers were asked to follow a framework to evaluate the book\\'s terminology, research citations, key contributors to the field, photos and illustrations, and related aspects, commenting on the representation and consideration of diverse groups. Significant additions and revisions were made in this regard, and the review framework itself is available among the OpenStax Psychology 2e instructor resources.Art and illustrationsUnder the guidance of the authors and expert scientific illustrators, especially those well versed in creating accessible art, the OpenStax team made changes throughout the art program in Psychology 2e.Accessibility improvementsAs with all OpenStax books, the first edition of Psychology was created with a focus on accessibility. We have emphasized and improved that approach in the second edition. Our goal is to ensure that all OpenStax websites and the web view versions of our learning materials follow accessible web design best practices, so that they will meet the W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 at Level AA and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. The WCAG 2.0 guidelines explain ways to make web content more accessible for people with disabilities and more user-friendly for everyone.To accommodate users of specific assistive technologies, all alternative text was reviewed and revised for comprehensiveness and clarity.- All illustrations were revised to improve the color contrast, which is important for some visually impaired students.Overall, the OpenStax platform has been continually upgraded to improve accessibility.To learn more about our commitment and progress, please view our accessibility statement (https://openstax.org/accessibility-statement).A transition guide will be available on openstax.org to highlight the specific chapter-level changes to the second edition.Pedagogical foundationPsychology 2e engages students through inquiry, self-reflection, and investigation. Features in the second edition have been carefully updated to remain topical and relevant while deepening students\\' relationship to the material. They include the following:- Everyday Connection features tie psychological topics to everyday issues and behaviors that students encounter in their lives and the world. Topics include the validity of scores on college entrance exams, the opioid crisis, the impact of social status on stress and healthcare, and cognitive mapping.What Do You Think? features provide research-based information and ask students their views on controversial issues.

Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these experiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain\\'s internal processes and people\\'s external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of psychology has explored these questions.1.1 What Is Psychology?LEARNING OBJECTIVESBy the end of this section, you will be able to:Define psychologyUnderstand the merits of an education in psychologyWhat is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology explores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists use the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question about how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the phenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or group of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over time. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes observations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then published or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.Scientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because it is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We must ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However, we can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus, psychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.In general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot arrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the mind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific method is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on observation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or previous authorities.It was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this time, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is, at its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological organism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore, psychology is also a social science.WHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?Often, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to learn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course because it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as nursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare psychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses across the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology majors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook\\'s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality and political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About 6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S. Department of Education, 2016).Access for free at openstax.org\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/What Is Psychology?\\', \\'page_num\\': 8.0, \\'id\\': 27.0}, page_content=\\'Critical Thinking Questions 246\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 246CHAPTER 8Memory 247\\\\nIntroduction 247\\\\n8.1 How Memory Functions 248\\\\n8.2 Parts of the Brain Involved with Memory 255\\\\n8.3 Problems with Memory 259\\\\n8.4 Ways to Enhance Memory 269\\\\nKey Terms 273\\\\nSummary 274\\\\nReview Questions 275\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 276\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 277CHAPTER 9Lifespan Development 279\\\\nIntroduction 279\\\\n9.1 What Is Lifespan Development? 280\\\\n9.2 Lifespan Theories 284\\\\n9.3 Stages of Development 292\\\\n9.4 Death and Dying 313\\\\nKey Terms 315\\\\nSummary 316\\\\nReview Questions 317\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 319\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 320CHAPTER 10\\\\nEmotion and Motivation\\\\n321\\\\nIntroduction 321\\\\n10.1 Motivation 322\\\\n10.2 Hunger and Eating 328\\\\n10.3 Sexual Behavior 334\\\\n10.4 Emotion 342\\\\nKey Terms 353\\\\nSummary 354\\\\nReview Questions 355\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 357\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 357CHAPTER 11\\\\nPersonality 359Introduction 359\\\\n11.1 What Is Personality? 360\\\\n11.2 Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective 362\\\\n11.3 Neo-Freudians: Adler, Erikson, Jung, andorney 368\\\\n11.4 Learning Approaches 373\\\\n11.5 Humanistic Approaches 377\\\\n11.6 Biological Approaches 378\\'), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/Contemporary Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 18.0, \\'id\\': 29.0}, page_content=\\'1Introduction to PsychologyFIGURE 1.1 Psychology is the scientific study of mind and behavior.

The text also includes coverage of the DSM-5 in examinations of psychological disorders. Psychology 2e incorporates discussions that reflect the diversity within the discipline, as well as the diversity of cultures and communities across the globe.Coverage and scopeThe first edition of Psychology has been used by thousands of faculty and hundreds of thousands of students since its publication in 2015. OpenStax mined our adopters\\' extensive and helpful feedback to identify the most significant revision needs while maintaining the organization that many instructors had incorporated into their courses. Specific surveys, pre-revision reviews, and customization analysis, as well as analytical data from OpenStax partners and online learning environments, all aided in planning the revision.The result is a book that thoroughly treats psychology\\'s foundational concepts while adding current and meaningful coverage in specific areas. Psychology 2e retains its manageable scope and contains ample features to draw learners into the discipline.Structurally, the textbook remains similar to the first edition, with no chapter reorganization and very targeted changes at the section level.Chapter 1: Introduction to PsychologyChapter 2: Psychological ResearchChapter 3: BiopsychologyChapter 4: States of ConsciousnessChapter 5: Sensation and PerceptionChapter 6: LearningChapter 7: Thinking and IntelligenceChapter 8: MemoryChapter 9: Lifespan DevelopmentChapter 10: Motivation and EmotionChapter 11: PersonalityChapter 12: Social PsychologyChapter 13: Industrial-Organizational PsychologyChapter 14: Stress, Lifestyle, and HealthChapter 15: Psychological DisordersChapter 16: Therapy and TreatmentChanges to the Second EditionOpenStax only undertakes second editions when significant modifications to the text are necessary. In the case of Psychology 2e, user feedback indicated that we needed to focus on a few key areas, which we have done in the following ways.Content revisions for clarity, accuracy, and currencyThe revision plan varied by chapter based on need. Some chapters were significantly updated for conceptual coverage, research-informed data, and clearer language. In other chapters, the revisions focused mostly on currency of examples and updates to statistics.Over 210 new research references have been added or updated in order to improve the scholarly underpinnings of the material and broaden the perspective for students. Dozens of examples and feature boxes have been changed or added to better explain concepts and/or increase relevance for students.Research replication and validityTo engage students in stronger critical analysis and inform them about research reproducibility, substantial coverage has been added to the research chapter and strategically throughout the textbook whenever keyAccess for free at openstax.org\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 14.0, \\'id\\': 25.0}, page_content=\"Preface 3studies are discussed. This material is presented in a balanced way and provides instructors with ample opportunity to discuss the importance of replication in a manner that best suits their course.Diversity, representation, and inclusionWith the help of researchers and teachers who focus on diversity- and identity-related issues, OpenStax has engaged in detailed diversity reviews to identify opportunities to improve the textbook. Reviewers were asked to follow a framework to evaluate the book\\'s terminology, research citations, key contributors to the field, photos and illustrations, and related aspects, commenting on the representation and consideration of diverse groups. Significant additions and revisions were made in this regard, and the review framework itself is available among the OpenStax Psychology 2e instructor resources.Art and illustrationsUnder the guidance of the authors and expert scientific illustrators, especially those well versed in creating accessible art, the OpenStax team made changes throughout the art program in Psychology 2e.Accessibility improvementsAs with all OpenStax books, the first edition of Psychology was created with a focus on accessibility. We have emphasized and improved that approach in the second edition. Our goal is to ensure that all OpenStax websites and the web view versions of our learning materials follow accessible web design best practices, so that they will meet the W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 at Level AA and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. The WCAG 2.0 guidelines explain ways to make web content more accessible for people with disabilities and more user-friendly for everyone.To accommodate users of specific assistive technologies, all alternative text was reviewed and revised for comprehensiveness and clarity.- All illustrations were revised to improve the color contrast, which is important for some visually impaired students.Overall, the OpenStax platform has been continually upgraded to improve accessibility.To learn more about our commitment and progress, please view our accessibility statement (https://openstax.org/accessibility-statement).A transition guide will be available on openstax.org to highlight the specific chapter-level changes to the second edition.Pedagogical foundationPsychology 2e engages students through inquiry, self-reflection, and investigation. Features in the second edition have been carefully updated to remain topical and relevant while deepening students\\' relationship to the material. They include the following:- Everyday Connection features tie psychological topics to everyday issues and behaviors that students encounter in their lives and the world. Topics include the validity of scores on college entrance exams, the opioid crisis, the impact of social status on stress and healthcare, and cognitive mapping.What Do You Think? features provide research-based information and ask students their views on controversial issues. Topics include “Brain Dead and on Life Support,” “Violent Media and Aggression,” and “Capital Punishment and Criminals with Intellectual Disabilities.”Dig Deeper features discuss one specific aspect of a topic in greater depth so students can dig more deeply into the concept. Examples include discussions on the distinction between evolutionary psychology and behavioral genetics, recent findings on neuroplasticity, the field of forensic psychology, and a presentation of research on strategies for coping with prejudice and discrimination.Connect the Concepts features revisit a concept learned in another chapter, expanding upon it within a different context.

While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember what he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is associated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend\\\\\\'s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John Nash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would tell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended for him. He also began to hear voices and became suspicious of the people around him. Soon thereafter, Nash was diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to a state-run mental institution (O\\\\\\'Connor & Robertson,\\'), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/Contemporary Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 19.0, \\'id\\': 42.0}, page_content=\"8 1 Introduction to Psychology2002). Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these experiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain\\'s internal processes and people\\'s external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of psychology has explored these questions.1.1 What Is Psychology?LEARNING OBJECTIVESBy the end of this section, you will be able to:Define psychologyUnderstand the merits of an education in psychologyWhat is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology explores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists use the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question about how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the phenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or group of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over time. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes observations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then published or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.Scientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because it is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We must ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However, we can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus, psychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.In general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot arrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the mind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific method is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on observation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or previous authorities.It was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this time, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is, at its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological organism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore, psychology is also a social science.WHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?Often, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to learn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course because it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as nursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare psychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses across the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology majors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook\\'s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality and political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About 6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S. Department of Education, 2016).Access for free at openstax.org\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 13.0, \\'id\\': 48.0}, page_content=\"2 Prefacestudies and current and emerging research. The text also includes coverage of the DSM-5 in examinations of psychological disorders. Psychology 2e incorporates discussions that reflect the diversity within the discipline, as well as the diversity of cultures and communities across the globe.Coverage and scopeThe first edition of Psychology has been used by thousands of faculty and hundreds of thousands of students since its publication in 2015. OpenStax mined our adopters\\' extensive and helpful feedback to identify the most significant revision needs while maintaining the organization that many instructors had incorporated into their courses. Specific surveys, pre-revision reviews, and customization analysis, as well as analytical data from OpenStax partners and online learning environments, all aided in planning the revision.The result is a book that thoroughly treats psychology\\'s foundational concepts while adding current and meaningful coverage in specific areas. Psychology 2e retains its manageable scope and contains ample features to draw learners into the discipline.Structurally, the textbook remains similar to the first edition, with no chapter reorganization and very targeted changes at the section level.Chapter 1: Introduction to PsychologyChapter 2: Psychological ResearchChapter 3: BiopsychologyChapter 4: States of ConsciousnessChapter 5: Sensation and PerceptionChapter 6: LearningChapter 7: Thinking and IntelligenceChapter 8: MemoryChapter 9: Lifespan DevelopmentChapter 10: Motivation and EmotionChapter 11: PersonalityChapter 12: Social PsychologyChapter 13: Industrial-Organizational PsychologyChapter 14: Stress, Lifestyle, and HealthChapter 15: Psychological DisordersChapter 16: Therapy and TreatmentChanges to the Second EditionOpenStax only undertakes second editions when significant modifications to the text are necessary. In the case of Psychology 2e, user feedback indicated that we needed to focus on a few key areas, which we have done in the following ways.Content revisions for clarity, accuracy, and currencyThe revision plan varied by chapter based on need. Some chapters were significantly updated for conceptual coverage, research-informed data, and clearer language. In other chapters, the revisions focused mostly on currency of examples and updates to statistics.Over 210 new research references have been added or updated in order to improve the scholarly underpinnings of the material and broaden the perspective for students. Dozens of examples and feature boxes have been changed or added to better explain concepts and/or increase relevance for students.Research replication and validityTo engage students in stronger critical analysis and inform them about research reproducibility, substantial coverage has been added to the research chapter and strategically throughout the textbook whenever keyAccess for free at openstax.org\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/What Is Psychology?\\', \\'page_num\\': 8.0, \\'id\\': 39.0}, page_content=\\'Critical Thinking Questions 246\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 246CHAPTER 8Memory 247\\\\nIntroduction 247\\\\n8.1 How Memory Functions 248\\\\n8.2 Parts of the Brain Involved with Memory 255\\\\n8.3 Problems with Memory 259\\\\n8.4 Ways to Enhance Memory 269\\\\nKey Terms 273\\\\nSummary 274\\\\nReview Questions 275\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 276\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 277CHAPTER 9Lifespan Development 279\\\\nIntroduction 279\\\\n9.1 What Is Lifespan Development? 280\\\\n9.2 Lifespan Theories 284\\\\n9.3 Stages of Development 292\\\\n9.4 Death and Dying 313\\\\nKey Terms 315\\\\nSummary 316\\\\nReview Questions 317\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 319\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 320CHAPTER 10\\\\nEmotion and Motivation\\\\n321\\\\nIntroduction 321\\\\n10.1 Motivation 322\\\\n10.2 Hunger and Eating 328\\\\n10.3 Sexual Behavior 334\\\\n10.4 Emotion 342\\\\nKey Terms 353\\\\nSummary 354\\\\nReview Questions 355\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 357\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 357CHAPTER 11\\\\nPersonality 359Introduction 359\\\\n11.1 What Is Personality? 360\\\\n11.2 Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective 362\\\\n11.3 Neo-Freudians: Adler, Erikson, Jung, and Horney 368\\\\n11.4 Learning Approaches 373\\\\n11.5 Humanistic Approaches 377\\\\n11.6 Biological Approaches 378\\'), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 14.0, \\'id\\': 37.0}, page_content=\"Prefacestudies are discussed. This material is presented in a balanced way and provides instructors with ample opportunity to discuss the importance of replication in a manner that best suits their course.Diversity, representation, and inclusionWith the help of researchers and teachers who focus on diversity- and identity-related issues, OpenStax has engaged in detailed diversity reviews to identify opportunities to improve the textbook. Reviewers were asked to follow a framework to evaluate the book\\'s terminology, research citations, key contributors to the field, photos and illustrations, and related aspects, commenting on the representation and consideration of diverse groups. Significant additions and revisions were made in this regard, and the review framework itself is available among the OpenStax Psychology 2e instructor resources.Art and illustrationsUnder the guidance of the authors and expert scientific illustrators, especially those well versed in creating accessible art, the OpenStax team made changes throughout the art program in Psychology 2e.Accessibility improvementsAs with all OpenStax books, the first edition of Psychology was created with a focus on accessibility. We have emphasized and improved that approach in the second edition. Our goal is to ensure that all OpenStax websites and the web view versions of our learning materials follow accessible web design best practices, so that they will meet the W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 at Level AA and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. The WCAG 2.0 guidelines explain ways to make web content more accessible for people with disabilities and more user-friendly for everyone.To accommodate users of specific assistive technologies, all alternative text was reviewed and revised for comprehensiveness and clarity.- All illustrations were revised to improve the color contrast, which is important for some visually impaired students.Overall, the OpenStax platform has been continually upgraded to improve accessibility.To learn more about our commitment and progress, please view our accessibility statement (https://openstax.org/accessibility-statement).A transition guide will be available on openstax.org to highlight the specific chapter-level changes to the second edition.Pedagogical foundationPsychology 2e engages students through inquiry, self-reflection, and investigation. Features in the second edition have been carefully updated to remain topical and relevant while deepening students\\' relationship to the material. They include the following:- Everyday Connection features tie psychological topics to everyday issues and behaviors that students encounter in their lives and the world. Topics include the validity of scores on college entrance exams, the opioid crisis, the impact of social status on stress and healthcare, and cognitive mapping.What Do You Think? features provide research-based information and ask students their views on controversial issues. Topics include “Brain Dead and on Life Support,” “Violent Media and Aggression,” and “Capital Punishment and Criminals with Intellectual Disabilities.”Dig Deeper features discuss one specific aspect of a topic in greater depth so students can dig more deeply into the concept. Examples include discussions on the distinction between evolutionary psychology and behavioral genetics, recent findings on neuroplasticity, the field of forensic psychology, and a presentation of research on strategies for coping with prejudice and discrimination.Connect the Concepts features revisit a concept learned in another chapter, expanding upon it within a different context. Features include “Emotional Expression and Emotional Regulation,” “Tweens, Teens,\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 12.0, \\'id\\': 38.0}, page_content=\"Preface 1PrefaceWelcome to Psychology 2e, an OpenStax resource.

While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember what he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is associated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend\\\\\\'s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John Nash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would tell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended for him. He also began to hear voices and became suspicious of the people around him. Soon thereafter, Nash was diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to a state-run mental institution (O\\\\\\'Connor & Robertson,\\'), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/Contemporary Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 19.0, \\'id\\': 42.0}, page_content=\"8 1 Introduction to Psychology2002). Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these experiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain\\'s internal processes and people\\'s external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of psychology has explored these questions.1.1 What Is Psychology?LEARNING OBJECTIVESBy the end of this section, you will be able to:Define psychologyUnderstand the merits of an education in psychologyWhat is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology explores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists use the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question about how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the phenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or group of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over time. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes observations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then published or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.Scientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because it is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We must ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However, we can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus, psychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.In general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot arrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the mind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific method is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on observation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or previous authorities.It was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this time, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is, at its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological organism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore, psychology is also a social science.WHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?Often, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to learn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course because it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as nursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare psychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses across the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology majors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook\\'s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality and political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About 6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S. Department of Education, 2016).Access for free at openstax.org\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 14.0, \\'id\\': 37.0}, page_content=\"Prefacestudies are discussed. This material is presented in a balanced way and provides instructors with ample opportunity to discuss the importance of replication in a manner that best suits their course.Diversity, representation, and inclusionWith the help of researchers and teachers who focus on diversity- and identity-related issues, OpenStax has engaged in detailed diversity reviews to identify opportunities to improve the textbook. Reviewers were asked to follow a framework to evaluate the book\\'s terminology, research citations, key contributors to the field, photos and illustrations, and related aspects, commenting on the representation and consideration of diverse groups. Significant additions and revisions were made in this regard, and the review framework itself is available among the OpenStax Psychology 2e instructor resources.Art and illustrationsUnder the guidance of the authors and expert scientific illustrators, especially those well versed in creating accessible art, the OpenStax team made changes throughout the art program in Psychology 2e.Accessibility improvementsAs with all OpenStax books, the first edition of Psychology was created with a focus on accessibility. We have emphasized and improved that approach in the second edition. Our goal is to ensure that all OpenStax websites and the web view versions of our learning materials follow accessible web design best practices, so that they will meet the W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 at Level AA and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. The WCAG 2.0 guidelines explain ways to make web content more accessible for people with disabilities and more user-friendly for everyone.To accommodate users of specific assistive technologies, all alternative text was reviewed and revised for comprehensiveness and clarity.- All illustrations were revised to improve the color contrast, which is important for some visually impaired students.Overall, the OpenStax platform has been continually upgraded to improve accessibility.To learn more about our commitment and progress, please view our accessibility statement (https://openstax.org/accessibility-statement).A transition guide will be available on openstax.org to highlight the specific chapter-level changes to the second edition.Pedagogical foundationPsychology 2e engages students through inquiry, self-reflection, and investigation. Features in the second edition have been carefully updated to remain topical and relevant while deepening students\\' relationship to the material. They include the following:- Everyday Connection features tie psychological topics to everyday issues and behaviors that students encounter in their lives and the world. Topics include the validity of scores on college entrance exams, the opioid crisis, the impact of social status on stress and healthcare, and cognitive mapping.What Do You Think? features provide research-based information and ask students their views on controversial issues. Topics include “Brain Dead and on Life Support,” “Violent Media and Aggression,” and “Capital Punishment and Criminals with Intellectual Disabilities.”Dig Deeper features discuss one specific aspect of a topic in greater depth so students can dig more deeply into the concept. Examples include discussions on the distinction between evolutionary psychology and behavioral genetics, recent findings on neuroplasticity, the field of forensic psychology, and a presentation of research on strategies for coping with prejudice and discrimination.Connect the Concepts features revisit a concept learned in another chapter, expanding upon it within a different context. Features include “Emotional Expression and Emotional Regulation,” “Tweens, Teens,\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 17.0, \\'id\\': 45.0}, page_content=\\'6 PrefaceChristine Selby, Husson University\\\\nSally B.

The four stages are:\\n\\n1. Sensorimotor stage (0-2 years): During this stage, children learn by using their senses and motor skills to interact with the environment.\\n2. Preoperational stage (2-7 years): In this stage, children begin to use symbols and language to represent the world, but they have difficulty with logical operations and reverse thinking.\\n3. Concrete operational stage (7-11 years): At this stage, children develop the ability to think logically and reason concretely, using concrete objects and events to understand abstract concepts.\\n4. Formal operational stage (11 years and up): In this final stage, children develop the ability to think abstractly and reason logically, using abstract concepts and hypothetical situations to understand the world.\\n\\nPiaget also proposed the concept of equilibration, which suggests that children are constantly striving to adapt their existing knowledge and understanding to new information and experiences. This process of adaptation involves a cycle of assimilation (integrating new information into existing knowledge) and accommodation (modifying existing knowledge to fit new information).\\n\\nOverall, Piaget's theories of cognitive development emphasize the importance of active learning, social interaction, and hands-on experience in shaping children's thinking and understanding of the world.\", 'type': 'output_text'}] role='assistant'\nSkipping a malformed document part due to: unmatched ')' (<unknown>, line 1)\nSkipping a malformed document part due to: unmatched ')' (<unknown>, line 1)\nSkipping a malformed document part due to: unmatched ')' (<unknown>, line 1)\nQuery 26\n[NOTICE] Using a notebook authentication token.

Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these experiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain\\'s internal processes and people\\'s external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of psychology has explored these questions.1.1 What Is Psychology?LEARNING OBJECTIVESBy the end of this section, you will be able to:Define psychologyUnderstand the merits of an education in psychologyWhat is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology explores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists use the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question about how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the phenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or group of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over time. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes observations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then published or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.Scientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because it is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We must ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However, we can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus, psychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.In general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot arrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the mind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific method is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on observation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or previous authorities.It was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this time, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is, at its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological organism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore, psychology is also a social science.WHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?Often, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to learn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course because it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as nursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare psychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses across the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology majors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook\\'s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality and political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About 6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S. Department of Education, 2016).Access for free at openstax.org\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/Contemporary Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 18.0, \\'id\\': 41.0}, page_content=\\'1Introduction to PsychologyFIGURE 1.1 Psychology is the scientific study of mind and behavior.

While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember what he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is associated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend\\\\\\'s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John Nash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would tell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended for him. He also began to hear voices and became suspicious of the people around him. Soon thereafter, Nash was diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to a state-run mental institution (O\\\\\\'Connor & Robertson,\\'), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/What Is Psychology?\\', \\'page_num\\': 8.0, \\'id\\': 39.0}, page_content=\\'Critical Thinking Questions 246\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 246CHAPTER 8Memory 247\\\\nIntroduction 247\\\\n8.1 How Memory Functions 248\\\\n8.2 Parts of the Brain Involved with Memory 255\\\\n8.3 Problems with Memory 259\\\\n8.4 Ways to Enhance Memory 269\\\\nKey Terms 273\\\\nSummary 274\\\\nReview Questions 275\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 276\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 277CHAPTER 9Lifespan Development 279\\\\nIntroduction 279\\\\n9.1 What Is Lifespan Development? 280\\\\n9.2 Lifespan Theories 284\\\\n9.3 Stages of Development 292\\\\n9.4 Death and Dying 313\\\\nKey Terms 315\\\\nSummary 316\\\\nReview Questions 317\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 319\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 320CHAPTER 10\\\\nEmotion and Motivation\\\\n321\\\\nIntroduction 321\\\\n10.1 Motivation 322\\\\n10.2 Hunger and Eating 328\\\\n10.3 Sexual Behavior 334\\\\n10.4 Emotion 342\\\\nKey Terms 353\\\\nSummary 354\\\\nReview Questions 355\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 357\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 357CHAPTER 11\\\\nPersonality 359Introduction 359\\\\n11.1 What Is Personality? 360\\\\n11.2 Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective 362\\\\n11.3 Neo-Freudians: Adler, Erikson, Jung, and Horney 368\\\\n11.4 Learning Approaches 373\\\\n11.5 Humanistic Approaches 377\\\\n11.6 Biological Approaches 378\\'), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 10.0, \\'id\\': 43.0}, page_content=\\'CHAPTER 15\\\\nPsychological DisordersIntroduction 537\\\\n15.1 What Are Psychological Disorders? 538\\\\n15.2 Diagnosing and Classifying Psychological Disorders 542\\\\n15.3 Perspectives on Psychological Disorders 545\\\\n15.4 Anxiety Disorders 548\\\\n15.5 Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders 554\\\\n15.6 Posttraumatic Stress Disorder 558\\\\n15.7 Mood and Related Disorders 560\\\\n15.8 Schizophrenia 570\\\\n15.9 Dissociative Disorders 574\\\\n15.10 Disorders in Childhood 576\\\\n15.11 Personality Disorders 582\\\\nKey Terms 589\\\\nSummary 591\\\\nReview Questions 594\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 597\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 598CHAPTER 16 Therapy and Treatment 599Introduction 599\\\\n16.1 Mental Health Treatment: Past and Present 600\\\\n16.2 Types of Treatment 605\\\\n16.3 Treatment Modalities 617\\\\n16.4 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders: A Special Case 621\\\\n16.5 The Sociocultural Model and Therapy Utilization 623\\\\nKey Terms 627\\\\nSummary 628\\\\nReview Questions 630\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 632\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 632\\\\nReferences 633\\\\nIndex 733\\'), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 15.0, \\'id\\': 46.0}, page_content=\\'4 Prefaceand Social Norms,\" and \"Conditioning and OCD.\"Art, interactives, and assessments that engageOur art program is designed to enhance students\\\\\\' understanding of psychological concepts through simple, effective graphs, diagrams, and photographs.

The text also includes coverage of the DSM-5 in examinations of psychological disorders. Psychology 2e incorporates discussions that reflect the diversity within the discipline, as well as the diversity of cultures and communities across the globe.Coverage and scopeThe first edition of Psychology has been used by thousands of faculty and hundreds of thousands of students since its publication in 2015. OpenStax mined our adopters\\' extensive and helpful feedback to identify the most significant revision needs while maintaining the organization that many instructors had incorporated into their courses. Specific surveys, pre-revision reviews, and customization analysis, as well as analytical data from OpenStax partners and online learning environments, all aided in planning the revision.The result is a book that thoroughly treats psychology\\'s foundational concepts while adding current and meaningful coverage in specific areas. Psychology 2e retains its manageable scope and contains ample features to draw learners into the discipline.Structurally, the textbook remains similar to the first edition, with no chapter reorganization and very targeted changes at the section level.Chapter 1: Introduction to PsychologyChapter 2: Psychological ResearchChapter 3: BiopsychologyChapter 4: States of ConsciousnessChapter 5: Sensation and PerceptionChapter 6: LearningChapter 7: Thinking and IntelligenceChapter 8: MemoryChapter 9: Lifespan DevelopmentChapter 10: Motivation and EmotionChapter 11: PersonalityChapter 12: Social PsychologyChapter 13: Industrial-Organizational PsychologyChapter 14: Stress, Lifestyle, and HealthChapter 15: Psychological DisordersChapter 16: Therapy and TreatmentChanges to the Second EditionOpenStax only undertakes second editions when significant modifications to the text are necessary. In the case of Psychology 2e, user feedback indicated that we needed to focus on a few key areas, which we have done in the following ways.Content revisions for clarity, accuracy, and currencyThe revision plan varied by chapter based on need. Some chapters were significantly updated for conceptual coverage, research-informed data, and clearer language. In other chapters, the revisions focused mostly on currency of examples and updates to statistics.Over 210 new research references have been added or updated in order to improve the scholarly underpinnings of the material and broaden the perspective for students. Dozens of examples and feature boxes have been changed or added to better explain concepts and/or increase relevance for students.Research replication and validityTo engage students in stronger critical analysis and inform them about research reproducibility, substantial coverage has been added to the research chapter and strategically throughout the textbook whenever keyAccess for free at openstax.org\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/Contemporary Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 19.0, \\'id\\': 42.0}, page_content=\"8 1 Introduction to Psychology2002). Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these experiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain\\'s internal processes and people\\'s external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of psychology has explored these questions.1.1 What Is Psychology?LEARNING OBJECTIVESBy the end of this section, you will be able to:Define psychologyUnderstand the merits of an education in psychologyWhat is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology explores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists use the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question about how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the phenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or group of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over time. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes observations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then published or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.Scientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because it is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We must ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However, we can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus, psychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.In general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot arrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the mind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific method is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on observation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or previous authorities.It was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this time, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is, at its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological organism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore, psychology is also a social science.WHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?Often, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to learn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course because it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as nursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare psychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses across the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology majors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook\\'s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality and political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About 6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S. Department of Education, 2016).Access for free at openstax.org\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 12.0, \\'id\\': 38.0}, page_content=\"Preface 1PrefaceWelcome to Psychology 2e, an OpenStax resource.

However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would tell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended for him. He also began to hear voices and became suspicious of the people around him. Soon thereafter, Nash was diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to a state-run mental institution (O\\\\\\'Connor & Robertson,\\'), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 12.0, \\'id\\': 38.0}, page_content=\"Preface 1PrefaceWelcome to Psychology 2e, an OpenStax resource.

In the case of Psychology 2e, user feedback indicated that we needed to focus on a few key areas, which we have done in the following ways.Content revisions for clarity, accuracy, and currencyThe revision plan varied by chapter based on need. Some chapters were significantly updated for conceptual coverage, research-informed data, and clearer language. In other chapters, the revisions focused mostly on currency of examples and updates to statistics.Over 210 new research references have been added or updated in order to improve the scholarly underpinnings of the material and broaden the perspective for students. Dozens of examples and feature boxes have been changed or added to better explain concepts and/or increase relevance for students.Research replication and validityTo engage students in stronger critical analysis and inform them about research reproducibility, substantial coverage has been added to the research chapter and strategically throughout the textbook whenever keyAccess for free at openstax.org\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 14.0, \\'id\\': 37.0}, page_content=\"Prefacestudies are discussed. This material is presented in a balanced way and provides instructors with ample opportunity to discuss the importance of replication in a manner that best suits their course.Diversity, representation, and inclusionWith the help of researchers and teachers who focus on diversity- and identity-related issues, OpenStax has engaged in detailed diversity reviews to identify opportunities to improve the textbook. Reviewers were asked to follow a framework to evaluate the book\\'s terminology, research citations, key contributors to the field, photos and illustrations, and related aspects, commenting on the representation and consideration of diverse groups. Significant additions and revisions were made in this regard, and the review framework itself is available among the OpenStax Psychology 2e instructor resources.Art and illustrationsUnder the guidance of the authors and expert scientific illustrators, especially those well versed in creating accessible art, the OpenStax team made changes throughout the art program in Psychology 2e.Accessibility improvementsAs with all OpenStax books, the first edition of Psychology was created with a focus on accessibility. We have emphasized and improved that approach in the second edition. Our goal is to ensure that all OpenStax websites and the web view versions of our learning materials follow accessible web design best practices, so that they will meet the W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 at Level AA and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. The WCAG 2.0 guidelines explain ways to make web content more accessible for people with disabilities and more user-friendly for everyone.To accommodate users of specific assistive technologies, all alternative text was reviewed and revised for comprehensiveness and clarity.- All illustrations were revised to improve the color contrast, which is important for some visually impaired students.Overall, the OpenStax platform has been continually upgraded to improve accessibility.To learn more about our commitment and progress, please view our accessibility statement (https://openstax.org/accessibility-statement).A transition guide will be available on openstax.org to highlight the specific chapter-level changes to the second edition.Pedagogical foundationPsychology 2e engages students through inquiry, self-reflection, and investigation. Features in the second edition have been carefully updated to remain topical and relevant while deepening students\\' relationship to the material. They include the following:- Everyday Connection features tie psychological topics to everyday issues and behaviors that students encounter in their lives and the world. Topics include the validity of scores on college entrance exams, the opioid crisis, the impact of social status on stress and healthcare, and cognitive mapping.What Do You Think? features provide research-based information and ask students their views on controversial issues. Topics include “Brain Dead and on Life Support,” “Violent Media and Aggression,” and “Capital Punishment and Criminals with Intellectual Disabilities.”Dig Deeper features discuss one specific aspect of a topic in greater depth so students can dig more deeply into the concept. Examples include discussions on the distinction between evolutionary psychology and behavioral genetics, recent findings on neuroplasticity, the field of forensic psychology, and a presentation of research on strategies for coping with prejudice and discrimination.Connect the Concepts features revisit a concept learned in another chapter, expanding upon it within a different context. Features include “Emotional Expression and Emotional Regulation,” “Tweens, Teens,\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/Contemporary Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 19.0, \\'id\\': 42.0}, page_content=\"8 1 Introduction to Psychology2002). Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these experiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain\\'s internal processes and people\\'s external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of psychology has explored these questions.1.1 What Is Psychology?LEARNING OBJECTIVESBy the end of this section, you will be able to:Define psychologyUnderstand the merits of an education in psychologyWhat is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology explores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists use the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question about how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the phenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or group of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over time. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes observations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then published or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.Scientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because it is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We must ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However, we can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus, psychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.In general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot arrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the mind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific method is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on observation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or previous authorities.It was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this time, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is, at its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological organism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore, psychology is also a social science.WHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?Often, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to learn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course because it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as nursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare psychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses across the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology majors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook\\'s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality and political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About 6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S. Department of Education, 2016).Access for free at openstax.org\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/What Is Psychology?\\', \\'page_num\\': 8.0, \\'id\\': 39.0}, page_content=\\'Critical Thinking Questions 246\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 246CHAPTER 8Memory 247\\\\nIntroduction 247\\\\n8.1 How Memory Functions 248\\\\n8.2 Parts of the Brain Involved with Memory 255\\\\n8.3 Problems with Memory 259\\\\n8.4 Ways to Enhance Memory 269\\\\nKey Terms 273\\\\nSummary 274\\\\nReview Questions 275\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 276\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 277CHAPTER 9Lifespan Development 279\\\\nIntroduction 279\\\\n9.1 What Is Lifespan Development? 280\\\\n9.2 Lifespan Theories 284\\\\n9.3 Stages of Development 292\\\\n9.4 Death and Dying 313\\\\nKey Terms 315\\\\nSummary 316\\\\nReview Questions 317\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 319\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 320CHAPTER 10\\\\nEmotion and Motivation\\\\n321\\\\nIntroduction 321\\\\n10.1 Motivation 322\\\\n10.2 Hunger and Eating 328\\\\n10.3 Sexual Behavior 334\\\\n10.4 Emotion 342\\\\nKey Terms 353\\\\nSummary 354\\\\nReview Questions 355\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 357\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 357CHAPTER 11\\\\nPersonality 359Introduction 359\\\\n11.1 What Is Personality? 360\\\\n11.2 Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective 362\\\\n11.3 Neo-Freudians: Adler, Erikson, Jung, and Horney 368\\\\n11.4 Learning Approaches 373\\\\n11.5 Humanistic Approaches 377\\\\n11.6 Biological Approaches 378\\'), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 15.0, \\'id\\': 46.0}, page_content=\\'4 Prefaceand Social Norms,\" and \"Conditioning and OCD.\"Art, interactives, and assessments that engageOur art program is designed to enhance students\\\\\\' understanding of psychological concepts through simple, effective graphs, diagrams, and photographs.

This material is presented in a balanced way and provides instructors with ample opportunity to discuss the importance of replication in a manner that best suits their course.Diversity, representation, and inclusionWith the help of researchers and teachers who focus on diversity- and identity-related issues, OpenStax has engaged in detailed diversity reviews to identify opportunities to improve the textbook. Reviewers were asked to follow a framework to evaluate the book\\'s terminology, research citations, key contributors to the field, photos and illustrations, and related aspects, commenting on the representation and consideration of diverse groups. Significant additions and revisions were made in this regard, and the review framework itself is available among the OpenStax Psychology 2e instructor resources.Art and illustrationsUnder the guidance of the authors and expert scientific illustrators, especially those well versed in creating accessible art, the OpenStax team made changes throughout the art program in Psychology 2e.Accessibility improvementsAs with all OpenStax books, the first edition of Psychology was created with a focus on accessibility. We have emphasized and improved that approach in the second edition. Our goal is to ensure that all OpenStax websites and the web view versions of our learning materials follow accessible web design best practices, so that they will meet the W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 at Level AA and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. The WCAG 2.0 guidelines explain ways to make web content more accessible for people with disabilities and more user-friendly for everyone.To accommodate users of specific assistive technologies, all alternative text was reviewed and revised for comprehensiveness and clarity.- All illustrations were revised to improve the color contrast, which is important for some visually impaired students.Overall, the OpenStax platform has been continually upgraded to improve accessibility.To learn more about our commitment and progress, please view our accessibility statement (https://openstax.org/accessibility-statement).A transition guide will be available on openstax.org to highlight the specific chapter-level changes to the second edition.Pedagogical foundationPsychology 2e engages students through inquiry, self-reflection, and investigation. Features in the second edition have been carefully updated to remain topical and relevant while deepening students\\' relationship to the material. They include the following:- Everyday Connection features tie psychological topics to everyday issues and behaviors that students encounter in their lives and the world. Topics include the validity of scores on college entrance exams, the opioid crisis, the impact of social status on stress and healthcare, and cognitive mapping.What Do You Think? features provide research-based information and ask students their views on controversial issues. Topics include “Brain Dead and on Life Support,” “Violent Media and Aggression,” and “Capital Punishment and Criminals with Intellectual Disabilities.”Dig Deeper features discuss one specific aspect of a topic in greater depth so students can dig more deeply into the concept. Examples include discussions on the distinction between evolutionary psychology and behavioral genetics, recent findings on neuroplasticity, the field of forensic psychology, and a presentation of research on strategies for coping with prejudice and discrimination.Connect the Concepts features revisit a concept learned in another chapter, expanding upon it within a different context. Features include “Emotional Expression and Emotional Regulation,” “Tweens, Teens,\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 9.0, \\'id\\': 40.0}, page_content=\\'11.7 Trait Theorists 379\\\\n11.8 Cultural Understandings of Personality 384\\\\n11.9 Personality Assessment 386\\\\nKey Terms 391\\\\nSummary 392\\\\nReview Questions 394\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 397\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 397CHAPTER 12\\\\nSocial Psychology 399Introduction 399\\\\n12.1 What Is Social Psychology? 400\\\\n12.2 Self-presentation 406\\\\n12.3 Attitudes and Persuasion 409\\\\n12.4 Conformity, Compliance, and Obedience 415\\\\n12.5 Prejudice and Discrimination 422\\\\n12.6 Aggression 429\\\\n12.7 Prosocial Behavior 432\\\\nKey Terms 437\\\\nSummary 439\\\\nReview Questions 440\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 444\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 444CHAPTER 13\\\\nIndustrial-Organizational PsychologyIntroduction 447\\\\n13.1 What Is Industrial and Organizational Psychology? 448\\\\n13.2 Industrial Psychology: Selecting and Evaluating Employees 456\\\\n13.3 Organizational Psychology: The Social Dimension of Work 467\\\\n13.4 Human Factors Psychology and Workplace Design 477\\\\nKey Terms 480\\\\nSummary 481\\\\nReview Questions 481\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 483\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 484CHAPTER 14 Stress, Lifestyle, and HealthIntroduction 485\\\\n14.1 What Is Stress? 486\\\\n14.2 Stressors 496\\\\n14.3 Stress and Illness 502\\\\n14.4 Regulation of Stress 514\\\\n14.5 The Pursuit of Happiness 521\\\\nKey Terms 529\\\\nSummary 530\\\\nReview Questions 531\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 534\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 535Access for free at openstax.org\\'), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 17.0, \\'id\\': 45.0}, page_content=\\'6 PrefaceChristine Selby, Husson University\\\\nSally B.

Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these experiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain\\'s internal processes and people\\'s external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of psychology has explored these questions.1.1 What Is Psychology?LEARNING OBJECTIVESBy the end of this section, you will be able to:Define psychologyUnderstand the merits of an education in psychologyWhat is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology explores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists use the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question about how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the phenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or group of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over time. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes observations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then published or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.Scientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because it is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We must ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However, we can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus, psychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.In general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot arrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the mind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific method is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on observation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or previous authorities.It was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this time, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is, at its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological organism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore, psychology is also a social science.WHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?Often, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to learn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course because it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as nursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare psychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses across the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology majors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook\\'s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality and political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About 6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S. Department of Education, 2016).Access for free at openstax.org\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 10.0, \\'id\\': 43.0}, page_content=\\'CHAPTER 15\\\\nPsychological DisordersIntroduction 537\\\\n15.1 What Are Psychological Disorders? 538\\\\n15.2 Diagnosing and Classifying Psychological Disorders 542\\\\n15.3 Perspectives on Psychological Disorders 545\\\\n15.4 Anxiety Disorders 548\\\\n15.5 Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders 554\\\\n15.6 Posttraumatic Stress Disorder 558\\\\n15.7 Mood and Related Disorders 560\\\\n15.8 Schizophrenia 570\\\\n15.9 Dissociative Disorders 574\\\\n15.10 Disorders in Childhood 576\\\\n15.11 Personality Disorders 582\\\\nKey Terms 589\\\\nSummary 591\\\\nReview Questions 594\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 597\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 598CHAPTER 16 Therapy and Treatment 599Introduction 599\\\\n16.1 Mental Health Treatment: Past and Present 600\\\\n16.2 Types of Treatment 605\\\\n16.3 Treatment Modalities 617\\\\n16.4 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders: A Special Case 621\\\\n16.5 The Sociocultural Model and Therapy Utilization 623\\\\nKey Terms 627\\\\nSummary 628\\\\nReview Questions 630\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 632\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 632\\\\nReferences 633\\\\nIndex 733\\'), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 13.0, \\'id\\': 48.0}, page_content=\"2 Prefacestudies and current and emerging research.

Psychology 2e incorporates discussions that reflect the diversity within the discipline, as well as the diversity of cultures and communities across the globe.Coverage and scopeThe first edition of Psychology has been used by thousands of faculty and hundreds of thousands of students since its publication in 2015. OpenStax mined our adopters\\' extensive and helpful feedback to identify the most significant revision needs while maintaining the organization that many instructors had incorporated into their courses. Specific surveys, pre-revision reviews, and customization analysis, as well as analytical data from OpenStax partners and online learning environments, all aided in planning the revision.The result is a book that thoroughly treats psychology\\'s foundational concepts while adding current and meaningful coverage in specific areas. Psychology 2e retains its manageable scope and contains ample features to draw learners into the discipline.Structurally, the textbook remains similar to the first edition, with no chapter reorganization and very targeted changes at the section level.Chapter 1: Introduction to PsychologyChapter 2: Psychological ResearchChapter 3: BiopsychologyChapter 4: States of ConsciousnessChapter 5: Sensation and PerceptionChapter 6: LearningChapter 7: Thinking and IntelligenceChapter 8: MemoryChapter 9: Lifespan DevelopmentChapter 10: Motivation and EmotionChapter 11: PersonalityChapter 12: Social PsychologyChapter 13: Industrial-Organizational PsychologyChapter 14: Stress, Lifestyle, and HealthChapter 15: Psychological DisordersChapter 16: Therapy and TreatmentChanges to the Second EditionOpenStax only undertakes second editions when significant modifications to the text are necessary. In the case of Psychology 2e, user feedback indicated that we needed to focus on a few key areas, which we have done in the following ways.Content revisions for clarity, accuracy, and currencyThe revision plan varied by chapter based on need. Some chapters were significantly updated for conceptual coverage, research-informed data, and clearer language. In other chapters, the revisions focused mostly on currency of examples and updates to statistics.Over 210 new research references have been added or updated in order to improve the scholarly underpinnings of the material and broaden the perspective for students. Dozens of examples and feature boxes have been changed or added to better explain concepts and/or increase relevance for students.Research replication and validityTo engage students in stronger critical analysis and inform them about research reproducibility, substantial coverage has been added to the research chapter and strategically throughout the textbook whenever keyAccess for free at openstax.org\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 17.0, \\'id\\': 45.0}, page_content=\\'6 PrefaceChristine Selby, Husson University\\\\nSally B.

James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is associated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend\\\\\\'s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John Nash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would tell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended for him. He also began to hear voices and became suspicious of the people around him. Soon thereafter, Nash was diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to a state-run mental institution (O\\\\\\'Connor & Robertson,\\'), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/Contemporary Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 19.0, \\'id\\': 42.0}, page_content=\"8 1 Introduction to Psychology2002). Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these experiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain\\'s internal processes and people\\'s external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of psychology has explored these questions.1.1 What Is Psychology?LEARNING OBJECTIVESBy the end of this section, you will be able to:Define psychologyUnderstand the merits of an education in psychologyWhat is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology explores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists use the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question about how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the phenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or group of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over time. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes observations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then published or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.Scientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because it is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We must ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However, we can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus, psychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.In general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot arrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the mind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific method is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on observation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or previous authorities.It was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this time, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is, at its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological organism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore, psychology is also a social science.WHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?Often, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to learn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course because it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as nursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare psychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses across the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology majors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook\\'s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality and political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About 6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S. Department of Education, 2016).Access for free at openstax.org\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 10.0, \\'id\\': 43.0}, page_content=\\'CHAPTER 15\\\\nPsychological DisordersIntroduction 537\\\\n15.1 What Are Psychological Disorders? 538\\\\n15.2 Diagnosing and Classifying Psychological Disorders 542\\\\n15.3 Perspectives on Psychological Disorders 545\\\\n15.4 Anxiety Disorders 548\\\\n15.5 Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders 554\\\\n15.6 Posttraumatic Stress Disorder 558\\\\n15.7 Mood and Related Disorders 560\\\\n15.8 Schizophrenia 570\\\\n15.9 Dissociative Disorders 574\\\\n15.10 Disorders in Childhood 576\\\\n15.11 Personality Disorders 582\\\\nKey Terms 589\\\\nSummary 591\\\\nReview Questions 594\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 597\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 598CHAPTER 16 Therapy and Treatment 599Introduction 599\\\\n16.1 Mental Health Treatment: Past and Present 600\\\\n16.2 Types of Treatment 605\\\\n16.3 Treatment Modalities 617\\\\n16.4 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders: A Special Case 621\\\\n16.5 The Sociocultural Model and Therapy Utilization 623\\\\nKey Terms 627\\\\nSummary 628\\\\nReview Questions 630\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 632\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 632\\\\nReferences 633\\\\nIndex 733\\'), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 13.0, \\'id\\': 48.0}, page_content=\"2 Prefacestudies and current and emerging research.

Psychology 2e incorporates discussions that reflect the diversity within the discipline, as well as the diversity of cultures and communities across the globe.Coverage and scopeThe first edition of Psychology has been used by thousands of faculty and hundreds of thousands of students since its publication in 2015. OpenStax mined our adopters\\' extensive and helpful feedback to identify the most significant revision needs while maintaining the organization that many instructors had incorporated into their courses. Specific surveys, pre-revision reviews, and customization analysis, as well as analytical data from OpenStax partners and online learning environments, all aided in planning the revision.The result is a book that thoroughly treats psychology\\'s foundational concepts while adding current and meaningful coverage in specific areas. Psychology 2e retains its manageable scope and contains ample features to draw learners into the discipline.Structurally, the textbook remains similar to the first edition, with no chapter reorganization and very targeted changes at the section level.Chapter 1: Introduction to PsychologyChapter 2: Psychological ResearchChapter 3: BiopsychologyChapter 4: States of ConsciousnessChapter 5: Sensation and PerceptionChapter 6: LearningChapter 7: Thinking and IntelligenceChapter 8: MemoryChapter 9: Lifespan DevelopmentChapter 10: Motivation and EmotionChapter 11: PersonalityChapter 12: Social PsychologyChapter 13: Industrial-Organizational PsychologyChapter 14: Stress, Lifestyle, and HealthChapter 15: Psychological DisordersChapter 16: Therapy and TreatmentChanges to the Second EditionOpenStax only undertakes second editions when significant modifications to the text are necessary. In the case of Psychology 2e, user feedback indicated that we needed to focus on a few key areas, which we have done in the following ways.Content revisions for clarity, accuracy, and currencyThe revision plan varied by chapter based on need. Some chapters were significantly updated for conceptual coverage, research-informed data, and clearer language. In other chapters, the revisions focused mostly on currency of examples and updates to statistics.Over 210 new research references have been added or updated in order to improve the scholarly underpinnings of the material and broaden the perspective for students. Dozens of examples and feature boxes have been changed or added to better explain concepts and/or increase relevance for students.Research replication and validityTo engage students in stronger critical analysis and inform them about research reproducibility, substantial coverage has been added to the research chapter and strategically throughout the textbook whenever keyAccess for free at openstax.org\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/What Is Psychology?\\', \\'page_num\\': 8.0, \\'id\\': 39.0}, page_content=\\'Critical Thinking Questions 246\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 246CHAPTER 8Memory 247\\\\nIntroduction 247\\\\n8.1 How Memory Functions 248\\\\n8.2 Parts of the Brain Involved with Memory 255\\\\n8.3 Problems with Memory 259\\\\n8.4 Ways to Enhance Memory 269\\\\nKey Terms 273\\\\nSummary 274\\\\nReview Questions 275\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 276\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 277CHAPTER 9Lifespan Development 279\\\\nIntroduction 279\\\\n9.1 What Is Lifespan Development? 280\\\\n9.2 Lifespan Theories 284\\\\n9.3 Stages of Development 292\\\\n9.4 Death and Dying 313\\\\nKey Terms 315\\\\nSummary 316\\\\nReview Questions 317\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 319\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 320CHAPTER 10\\\\nEmotion and Motivation\\\\n321\\\\nIntroduction 321\\\\n10.1 Motivation 322\\\\n10.2 Hunger and Eating 328\\\\n10.3 Sexual Behavior 334\\\\n10.4 Emotion 342\\\\nKey Terms 353\\\\nSummary 354\\\\nReview Questions 355\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 357\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 357CHAPTER 11\\\\nPersonality 359Introduction 359\\\\n11.1 What Is Personality? 360\\\\n11.2 Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective 362\\\\n11.3 Neo-Freudians: Adler, Erikson, Jung, and Horney 368\\\\n11.4 Learning Approaches 373\\\\n11.5 Humanistic Approaches 377\\\\n11.6 Biological Approaches 378\\'), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 14.0, \\'id\\': 37.0}, page_content=\"Prefacestudies are discussed.

Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these experiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain\\'s internal processes and people\\'s external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of psychology has explored these questions.1.1 What Is Psychology?LEARNING OBJECTIVESBy the end of this section, you will be able to:Define psychologyUnderstand the merits of an education in psychologyWhat is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology explores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists use the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question about how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the phenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or group of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over time. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes observations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then published or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.Scientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because it is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We must ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However, we can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus, psychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.In general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot arrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the mind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific method is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on observation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or previous authorities.It was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this time, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is, at its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological organism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore, psychology is also a social science.WHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?Often, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to learn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course because it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as nursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare psychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses across the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology majors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook\\'s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality and political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About 6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S. Department of Education, 2016).Access for free at openstax.org\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/Contemporary Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 18.0, \\'id\\': 41.0}, page_content=\\'1Introduction to PsychologyFIGURE 1.1 Psychology is the scientific study of mind and behavior.

While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember what he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is associated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend\\\\\\'s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John Nash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would tell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended for him. He also began to hear voices and became suspicious of the people around him. Soon thereafter, Nash was diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to a state-run mental institution (O\\\\\\'Connor & Robertson,\\'), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 9.0, \\'id\\': 40.0}, page_content=\\'11.7 Trait Theorists 379\\\\n11.8 Cultural Understandings of Personality 384\\\\n11.9 Personality Assessment 386\\\\nKey Terms 391\\\\nSummary 392\\\\nReview Questions 394\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 397\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 397CHAPTER 12\\\\nSocial Psychology 399Introduction 399\\\\n12.1 What Is Social Psychology? 400\\\\n12.2 Self-presentation 406\\\\n12.3 Attitudes and Persuasion 409\\\\n12.4 Conformity, Compliance, and Obedience 415\\\\n12.5 Prejudice and Discrimination 422\\\\n12.6 Aggression 429\\\\n12.7 Prosocial Behavior 432\\\\nKey Terms 437\\\\nSummary 439\\\\nReview Questions 440\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 444\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 444CHAPTER 13\\\\nIndustrial-Organizational PsychologyIntroduction 447\\\\n13.1 What Is Industrial and Organizational Psychology? 448\\\\n13.2 Industrial Psychology: Selecting and Evaluating Employees 456\\\\n13.3 Organizational Psychology: The Social Dimension of Work 467\\\\n13.4 Human Factors Psychology and Workplace Design 477\\\\nKey Terms 480\\\\nSummary 481\\\\nReview Questions 481\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 483\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 484CHAPTER 14 Stress, Lifestyle, and HealthIntroduction 485\\\\n14.1 What Is Stress? 486\\\\n14.2 Stressors 496\\\\n14.3 Stress and Illness 502\\\\n14.4 Regulation of Stress 514\\\\n14.5 The Pursuit of Happiness 521\\\\nKey Terms 529\\\\nSummary 530\\\\nReview Questions 531\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 534\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 535Access for free at openstax.org\\'), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 10.0, \\'id\\': 43.0}, page_content=\\'CHAPTER 15\\\\nPsychological DisordersIntroduction 537\\\\n15.1 What Are Psychological Disorders? 538\\\\n15.2 Diagnosing and Classifying Psychological Disorders 542\\\\n15.3 Perspectives on Psychological Disorders 545\\\\n15.4 Anxiety Disorders 548\\\\n15.5 Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders 554\\\\n15.6 Posttraumatic Stress Disorder 558\\\\n15.7 Mood and Related Disorders 560\\\\n15.8 Schizophrenia 570\\\\n15.9 Dissociative Disorders 574\\\\n15.10 Disorders in Childhood 576\\\\n15.11 Personality Disorders 582\\\\nKey Terms 589\\\\nSummary 591\\\\nReview Questions 594\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 597\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 598CHAPTER 16 Therapy and Treatment 599Introduction 599\\\\n16.1 Mental Health Treatment: Past and Present 600\\\\n16.2 Types of Treatment 605\\\\n16.3 Treatment Modalities 617\\\\n16.4 Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders: A Special Case 621\\\\n16.5 The Sociocultural Model and Therapy Utilization 623\\\\nKey Terms 627\\\\nSummary 628\\\\nReview Questions 630\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 632\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 632\\\\nReferences 633\\\\nIndex 733\\'), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 13.0, \\'id\\': 48.0}, page_content=\"2 Prefacestudies and current and emerging research.

Some chapters were significantly updated for conceptual coverage, research-informed data, and clearer language. In other chapters, the revisions focused mostly on currency of examples and updates to statistics.Over 210 new research references have been added or updated in order to improve the scholarly underpinnings of the material and broaden the perspective for students. Dozens of examples and feature boxes have been changed or added to better explain concepts and/or increase relevance for students.Research replication and validityTo engage students in stronger critical analysis and inform them about research reproducibility, substantial coverage has been added to the research chapter and strategically throughout the textbook whenever keyAccess for free at openstax.org\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 12.0, \\'id\\': 38.0}, page_content=\"Preface 1PrefaceWelcome to Psychology 2e, an OpenStax resource.

Reviewers were asked to follow a framework to evaluate the book\\'s terminology, research citations, key contributors to the field, photos and illustrations, and related aspects, commenting on the representation and consideration of diverse groups. Significant additions and revisions were made in this regard, and the review framework itself is available among the OpenStax Psychology 2e instructor resources.Art and illustrationsUnder the guidance of the authors and expert scientific illustrators, especially those well versed in creating accessible art, the OpenStax team made changes throughout the art program in Psychology 2e.Accessibility improvementsAs with all OpenStax books, the first edition of Psychology was created with a focus on accessibility. We have emphasized and improved that approach in the second edition. Our goal is to ensure that all OpenStax websites and the web view versions of our learning materials follow accessible web design best practices, so that they will meet the W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 at Level AA and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. The WCAG 2.0 guidelines explain ways to make web content more accessible for people with disabilities and more user-friendly for everyone.To accommodate users of specific assistive technologies, all alternative text was reviewed and revised for comprehensiveness and clarity.- All illustrations were revised to improve the color contrast, which is important for some visually impaired students.Overall, the OpenStax platform has been continually upgraded to improve accessibility.To learn more about our commitment and progress, please view our accessibility statement (https://openstax.org/accessibility-statement).A transition guide will be available on openstax.org to highlight the specific chapter-level changes to the second edition.Pedagogical foundationPsychology 2e engages students through inquiry, self-reflection, and investigation. Features in the second edition have been carefully updated to remain topical and relevant while deepening students\\' relationship to the material. They include the following:- Everyday Connection features tie psychological topics to everyday issues and behaviors that students encounter in their lives and the world. Topics include the validity of scores on college entrance exams, the opioid crisis, the impact of social status on stress and healthcare, and cognitive mapping.What Do You Think? features provide research-based information and ask students their views on controversial issues. Topics include “Brain Dead and on Life Support,” “Violent Media and Aggression,” and “Capital Punishment and Criminals with Intellectual Disabilities.”Dig Deeper features discuss one specific aspect of a topic in greater depth so students can dig more deeply into the concept. Examples include discussions on the distinction between evolutionary psychology and behavioral genetics, recent findings on neuroplasticity, the field of forensic psychology, and a presentation of research on strategies for coping with prejudice and discrimination.Connect the Concepts features revisit a concept learned in another chapter, expanding upon it within a different context. Features include “Emotional Expression and Emotional Regulation,” “Tweens, Teens,\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 17.0, \\'id\\': 45.0}, page_content=\\'6 PrefaceChristine Selby, Husson University\\\\nSally B.

This material is presented in a balanced way and provides instructors with ample opportunity to discuss the importance of replication in a manner that best suits their course.Diversity, representation, and inclusionWith the help of researchers and teachers who focus on diversity- and identity-related issues, OpenStax has engaged in detailed diversity reviews to identify opportunities to improve the textbook. Reviewers were asked to follow a framework to evaluate the book\\'s terminology, research citations, key contributors to the field, photos and illustrations, and related aspects, commenting on the representation and consideration of diverse groups. Significant additions and revisions were made in this regard, and the review framework itself is available among the OpenStax Psychology 2e instructor resources.Art and illustrationsUnder the guidance of the authors and expert scientific illustrators, especially those well versed in creating accessible art, the OpenStax team made changes throughout the art program in Psychology 2e.Accessibility improvementsAs with all OpenStax books, the first edition of Psychology was created with a focus on accessibility. We have emphasized and improved that approach in the second edition. Our goal is to ensure that all OpenStax websites and the web view versions of our learning materials follow accessible web design best practices, so that they will meet the W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 at Level AA and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. The WCAG 2.0 guidelines explain ways to make web content more accessible for people with disabilities and more user-friendly for everyone.To accommodate users of specific assistive technologies, all alternative text was reviewed and revised for comprehensiveness and clarity.- All illustrations were revised to improve the color contrast, which is important for some visually impaired students.Overall, the OpenStax platform has been continually upgraded to improve accessibility.To learn more about our commitment and progress, please view our accessibility statement (https://openstax.org/accessibility-statement).A transition guide will be available on openstax.org to highlight the specific chapter-level changes to the second edition.Pedagogical foundationPsychology 2e engages students through inquiry, self-reflection, and investigation. Features in the second edition have been carefully updated to remain topical and relevant while deepening students\\' relationship to the material. They include the following:- Everyday Connection features tie psychological topics to everyday issues and behaviors that students encounter in their lives and the world. Topics include the validity of scores on college entrance exams, the opioid crisis, the impact of social status on stress and healthcare, and cognitive mapping.What Do You Think? features provide research-based information and ask students their views on controversial issues. Topics include “Brain Dead and on Life Support,” “Violent Media and Aggression,” and “Capital Punishment and Criminals with Intellectual Disabilities.”Dig Deeper features discuss one specific aspect of a topic in greater depth so students can dig more deeply into the concept. Examples include discussions on the distinction between evolutionary psychology and behavioral genetics, recent findings on neuroplasticity, the field of forensic psychology, and a presentation of research on strategies for coping with prejudice and discrimination.Connect the Concepts features revisit a concept learned in another chapter, expanding upon it within a different context. Features include “Emotional Expression and Emotional Regulation,” “Tweens, Teens,\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 12.0, \\'id\\': 38.0}, page_content=\"Preface 1PrefaceWelcome to Psychology 2e, an OpenStax resource.

Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these experiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain\\'s internal processes and people\\'s external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of psychology has explored these questions.1.1 What Is Psychology?LEARNING OBJECTIVESBy the end of this section, you will be able to:Define psychologyUnderstand the merits of an education in psychologyWhat is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology explores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists use the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question about how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the phenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or group of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over time. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes observations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then published or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.Scientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because it is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We must ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However, we can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus, psychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.In general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot arrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the mind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific method is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on observation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or previous authorities.It was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this time, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is, at its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological organism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore, psychology is also a social science.WHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?Often, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to learn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course because it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as nursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare psychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses across the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology majors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook\\'s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality and political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About 6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S. Department of Education, 2016).Access for free at openstax.org\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 17.0, \\'id\\': 45.0}, page_content=\\'6 PrefaceChristine Selby, Husson University\\\\nSally B.

While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember what he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is associated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend\\\\\\'s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John Nash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would tell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended for him. He also began to hear voices and became suspicious of the people around him. Soon thereafter, Nash was diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to a state-run mental institution (O\\\\\\'Connor & Robertson,\\'), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 16.0, \\'id\\': 44.0}, page_content=\"Preface 5Contributing AuthorsMara Arguete, Lincoln University\\\\nLaura Bryant, Eastern Gateway Community College\\\\nBarbara Chappell, Walden University\\\\nKathryn Dumper, Bainbridge State College\\\\nArlene Lacombe, Saint Joseph\\'s University\\\\nJulie Lazzara, Paradise Valley Community College\\\\nTammy McClain, West Liberty University\\\\nBarbara B.

Phallic stage (3-6 years): The child's focus of pleasure shifts to the genitals. The Oedipus complex emerges, where the child becomes aware of their desire for the opposite-sex parent.\\n4. Latency stage (6-12 years): This stage is characterized by a decrease in libidinal desires. The child focuses on social and cultural learning, and their energy is redirected towards peer relationships and social interactions.\\n5. Genital stage ( puberty onwards): The final stage is characterized by the rise of sex hormones and the development of secondary sex characteristics.

Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these experiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain\\'s internal processes and people\\'s external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of psychology has explored these questions.1.1 What Is Psychology?LEARNING OBJECTIVESBy the end of this section, you will be able to:Define psychologyUnderstand the merits of an education in psychologyWhat is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology explores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists use the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question about how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the phenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or group of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over time. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes observations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then published or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.Scientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because it is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We must ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However, we can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus, psychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.In general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot arrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the mind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific method is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on observation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or previous authorities.It was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this time, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is, at its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological organism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore, psychology is also a social science.WHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?Often, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to learn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course because it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as nursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare psychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses across the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology majors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook\\'s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality and political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About 6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S. Department of Education, 2016).Access for free at openstax.org\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 17.0, \\'id\\': 45.0}, page_content=\\'6 PrefaceChristine Selby, Husson University\\\\nSally B.

Reviewers were asked to follow a framework to evaluate the book\\'s terminology, research citations, key contributors to the field, photos and illustrations, and related aspects, commenting on the representation and consideration of diverse groups. Significant additions and revisions were made in this regard, and the review framework itself is available among the OpenStax Psychology 2e instructor resources.Art and illustrationsUnder the guidance of the authors and expert scientific illustrators, especially those well versed in creating accessible art, the OpenStax team made changes throughout the art program in Psychology 2e.Accessibility improvementsAs with all OpenStax books, the first edition of Psychology was created with a focus on accessibility. We have emphasized and improved that approach in the second edition. Our goal is to ensure that all OpenStax websites and the web view versions of our learning materials follow accessible web design best practices, so that they will meet the W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 at Level AA and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. The WCAG 2.0 guidelines explain ways to make web content more accessible for people with disabilities and more user-friendly for everyone.To accommodate users of specific assistive technologies, all alternative text was reviewed and revised for comprehensiveness and clarity.- All illustrations were revised to improve the color contrast, which is important for some visually impaired students.Overall, the OpenStax platform has been continually upgraded to improve accessibility.To learn more about our commitment and progress, please view our accessibility statement (https://openstax.org/accessibility-statement).A transition guide will be available on openstax.org to highlight the specific chapter-level changes to the second edition.Pedagogical foundationPsychology 2e engages students through inquiry, self-reflection, and investigation. Features in the second edition have been carefully updated to remain topical and relevant while deepening students\\' relationship to the material. They include the following:- Everyday Connection features tie psychological topics to everyday issues and behaviors that students encounter in their lives and the world. Topics include the validity of scores on college entrance exams, the opioid crisis, the impact of social status on stress and healthcare, and cognitive mapping.What Do You Think? features provide research-based information and ask students their views on controversial issues. Topics include “Brain Dead and on Life Support,” “Violent Media and Aggression,” and “Capital Punishment and Criminals with Intellectual Disabilities.”Dig Deeper features discuss one specific aspect of a topic in greater depth so students can dig more deeply into the concept. Examples include discussions on the distinction between evolutionary psychology and behavioral genetics, recent findings on neuroplasticity, the field of forensic psychology, and a presentation of research on strategies for coping with prejudice and discrimination.Connect the Concepts features revisit a concept learned in another chapter, expanding upon it within a different context. Features include “Emotional Expression and Emotional Regulation,” “Tweens, Teens,\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/Contemporary Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 18.0, \\'id\\': 41.0}, page_content=\\'1Introduction to PsychologyFIGURE 1.1 Psychology is the scientific study of mind and behavior.

While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember what he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is associated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend\\\\\\'s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John Nash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would tell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended for him. He also began to hear voices and became suspicious of the people around him. Soon thereafter, Nash was diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to a state-run mental institution (O\\\\\\'Connor & Robertson,\\')]'\ntype='function_call' id='run--7ce4ca80-1abe-4870-bb25-959c1b279743' call_id='call_25811937-875f-4bef-b21c-cd19f63d0060' name='main__casml__knowledge_base_vs_index' arguments='{\"query\": \"industrial-organizational psychology themes\", \"filters\": null}'\ntype='function_call_output' call_id='call_25811937-875f-4bef-b21c-cd19f63d0060' output='[Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 9.0, \\'id\\': 40.0}, page_content=\\'11.7 Trait Theorists 379\\\\n11.8 Cultural Understandings of Personality 384\\\\n11.9 Personality Assessment 386\\\\nKey Terms 391\\\\nSummary 392\\\\nReview Questions 394\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 397\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 397CHAPTER 12\\\\nSocial Psychology 399Introduction 399\\\\n12.1 What Is Social Psychology? 400\\\\n12.2 Self-presentation 406\\\\n12.3 Attitudes and Persuasion 409\\\\n12.4 Conformity, Compliance, and Obedience 415\\\\n12.5 Prejudice and Discrimination 422\\\\n12.6 Aggression 429\\\\n12.7 Prosocial Behavior 432\\\\nKey Terms 437\\\\nSummary 439\\\\nReview Questions 440\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 444\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 444CHAPTER 13\\\\nIndustrial-Organizational PsychologyIntroduction 447\\\\n13.1 What Is Industrial and Organizational Psychology? 448\\\\n13.2 Industrial Psychology: Selecting and Evaluating Employees 456\\\\n13.3 Organizational Psychology: The Social Dimension of Work 467\\\\n13.4 Human Factors Psychology and Workplace Design 477\\\\nKey Terms 480\\\\nSummary 481\\\\nReview Questions 481\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 483\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 484CHAPTER 14 Stress, Lifestyle, and HealthIntroduction 485\\\\n14.1 What Is Stress? 486\\\\n14.2 Stressors 496\\\\n14.3 Stress and Illness 502\\\\n14.4 Regulation of Stress 514\\\\n14.5 The Pursuit of Happiness 521\\\\nKey Terms 529\\\\nSummary 530\\\\nReview Questions 531\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 534\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 535Access for free at openstax.org\\'), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 13.0, \\'id\\': 48.0}, page_content=\"2 Prefacestudies and current and emerging research.

Psychology 2e incorporates discussions that reflect the diversity within the discipline, as well as the diversity of cultures and communities across the globe.Coverage and scopeThe first edition of Psychology has been used by thousands of faculty and hundreds of thousands of students since its publication in 2015. OpenStax mined our adopters\\' extensive and helpful feedback to identify the most significant revision needs while maintaining the organization that many instructors had incorporated into their courses. Specific surveys, pre-revision reviews, and customization analysis, as well as analytical data from OpenStax partners and online learning environments, all aided in planning the revision.The result is a book that thoroughly treats psychology\\'s foundational concepts while adding current and meaningful coverage in specific areas. Psychology 2e retains its manageable scope and contains ample features to draw learners into the discipline.Structurally, the textbook remains similar to the first edition, with no chapter reorganization and very targeted changes at the section level.Chapter 1: Introduction to PsychologyChapter 2: Psychological ResearchChapter 3: BiopsychologyChapter 4: States of ConsciousnessChapter 5: Sensation and PerceptionChapter 6: LearningChapter 7: Thinking and IntelligenceChapter 8: MemoryChapter 9: Lifespan DevelopmentChapter 10: Motivation and EmotionChapter 11: PersonalityChapter 12: Social PsychologyChapter 13: Industrial-Organizational PsychologyChapter 14: Stress, Lifestyle, and HealthChapter 15: Psychological DisordersChapter 16: Therapy and TreatmentChanges to the Second EditionOpenStax only undertakes second editions when significant modifications to the text are necessary. In the case of Psychology 2e, user feedback indicated that we needed to focus on a few key areas, which we have done in the following ways.Content revisions for clarity, accuracy, and currencyThe revision plan varied by chapter based on need. Some chapters were significantly updated for conceptual coverage, research-informed data, and clearer language. In other chapters, the revisions focused mostly on currency of examples and updates to statistics.Over 210 new research references have been added or updated in order to improve the scholarly underpinnings of the material and broaden the perspective for students. Dozens of examples and feature boxes have been changed or added to better explain concepts and/or increase relevance for students.Research replication and validityTo engage students in stronger critical analysis and inform them about research reproducibility, substantial coverage has been added to the research chapter and strategically throughout the textbook whenever keyAccess for free at openstax.org\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/What Is Psychology?\\', \\'page_num\\': 8.0, \\'id\\': 39.0}, page_content=\\'Critical Thinking Questions 246\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 246CHAPTER 8Memory 247\\\\nIntroduction 247\\\\n8.1 How Memory Functions 248\\\\n8.2 Parts of the Brain Involved with Memory 255\\\\n8.3 Problems with Memory 259\\\\n8.4 Ways to Enhance Memory 269\\\\nKey Terms 273\\\\nSummary 274\\\\nReview Questions 275\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 276\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 277CHAPTER 9Lifespan Development 279\\\\nIntroduction 279\\\\n9.1 What Is Lifespan Development? 280\\\\n9.2 Lifespan Theories 284\\\\n9.3 Stages of Development 292\\\\n9.4 Death and Dying 313\\\\nKey Terms 315\\\\nSummary 316\\\\nReview Questions 317\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 319\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 320CHAPTER 10\\\\nEmotion and Motivation\\\\n321\\\\nIntroduction 321\\\\n10.1 Motivation 322\\\\n10.2 Hunger and Eating 328\\\\n10.3 Sexual Behavior 334\\\\n10.4 Emotion 342\\\\nKey Terms 353\\\\nSummary 354\\\\nReview Questions 355\\\\nCritical Thinking Questions 357\\\\nPersonal Application Questions 357CHAPTER 11\\\\nPersonality 359Introduction 359\\\\n11.1 What Is Personality? 360\\\\n11.2 Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective 362\\\\n11.3 Neo-Freudians: Adler, Erikson, Jung, and Horney 368\\\\n11.4 Learning Approaches 373\\\\n11.5 Humanistic Approaches 377\\\\n11.6 Biological Approaches 378\\'), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/History of Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 15.0, \\'id\\': 46.0}, page_content=\\'4 Prefaceand Social Norms,\" and \"Conditioning and OCD.\"Art, interactives, and assessments that engageOur art program is designed to enhance students\\\\\\' understanding of psychological concepts through simple, effective graphs, diagrams, and photographs.

This material is presented in a balanced way and provides instructors with ample opportunity to discuss the importance of replication in a manner that best suits their course.Diversity, representation, and inclusionWith the help of researchers and teachers who focus on diversity- and identity-related issues, OpenStax has engaged in detailed diversity reviews to identify opportunities to improve the textbook. Reviewers were asked to follow a framework to evaluate the book\\'s terminology, research citations, key contributors to the field, photos and illustrations, and related aspects, commenting on the representation and consideration of diverse groups. Significant additions and revisions were made in this regard, and the review framework itself is available among the OpenStax Psychology 2e instructor resources.Art and illustrationsUnder the guidance of the authors and expert scientific illustrators, especially those well versed in creating accessible art, the OpenStax team made changes throughout the art program in Psychology 2e.Accessibility improvementsAs with all OpenStax books, the first edition of Psychology was created with a focus on accessibility. We have emphasized and improved that approach in the second edition. Our goal is to ensure that all OpenStax websites and the web view versions of our learning materials follow accessible web design best practices, so that they will meet the W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 at Level AA and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. The WCAG 2.0 guidelines explain ways to make web content more accessible for people with disabilities and more user-friendly for everyone.To accommodate users of specific assistive technologies, all alternative text was reviewed and revised for comprehensiveness and clarity.- All illustrations were revised to improve the color contrast, which is important for some visually impaired students.Overall, the OpenStax platform has been continually upgraded to improve accessibility.To learn more about our commitment and progress, please view our accessibility statement (https://openstax.org/accessibility-statement).A transition guide will be available on openstax.org to highlight the specific chapter-level changes to the second edition.Pedagogical foundationPsychology 2e engages students through inquiry, self-reflection, and investigation. Features in the second edition have been carefully updated to remain topical and relevant while deepening students\\' relationship to the material. They include the following:- Everyday Connection features tie psychological topics to everyday issues and behaviors that students encounter in their lives and the world. Topics include the validity of scores on college entrance exams, the opioid crisis, the impact of social status on stress and healthcare, and cognitive mapping.What Do You Think? features provide research-based information and ask students their views on controversial issues. Topics include “Brain Dead and on Life Support,” “Violent Media and Aggression,” and “Capital Punishment and Criminals with Intellectual Disabilities.”Dig Deeper features discuss one specific aspect of a topic in greater depth so students can dig more deeply into the concept. Examples include discussions on the distinction between evolutionary psychology and behavioral genetics, recent findings on neuroplasticity, the field of forensic psychology, and a presentation of research on strategies for coping with prejudice and discrimination.Connect the Concepts features revisit a concept learned in another chapter, expanding upon it within a different context. Features include “Emotional Expression and Emotional Regulation,” “Tweens, Teens,\"), Document(metadata={\\'section\\': \\'Introduction to Psychology/Contemporary Psychology\\', \\'page_num\\': 18.0, \\'id\\': 41.0}, page_content=\\'1Introduction to PsychologyFIGURE 1.1 Psychology is the scientific study of mind and behavior.

While he can remember how to play the piano perfectly, he cannot remember what he ate for breakfast just an hour ago (Sacks, 2007). James Wannerton experiences a taste sensation that is associated with the sound of words. His former girlfriend\\\\\\'s name tastes like rhubarb (Mundasad, 2013). John Nash is a brilliant mathematician and Nobel Prize winner. However, while he was a professor at MIT, he would tell people that the New York Times contained coded messages from extraterrestrial beings that were intended for him. He also began to hear voices and became suspicious of the people around him. Soon thereafter, Nash was diagnosed with schizophrenia and admitted to a state-run mental institution (O\\\\\\'Connor & Robertson,\\')]'\ntype='message' id='run--e523563d-0f85-4748-9f74-4f5c0a57fbd5' content=[{'text': 'The major themes in industrial-organizational psychology include:\\n\\n1.
